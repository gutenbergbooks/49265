<h2 class="p4"><a name="cvii" id="cvii">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> strange adventures of the Ladies Katherine
and Mary Grey, although they excited great
interest at the time of their happening, and were
of immense contemporary political importance,
are now almost unknown, even to professed
students of Elizabethan history. The sad fate
of these unfortunate princesses has paled before
that of their more famous sister, Lady Jane Grey,
who, although the heroine of an appalling tragedy,
was rather the victim of others than of her own
actions. In a sense, she was merely a lay-figure,
whereas her sisters, especially Lady Katherine,
who played an active part on the stage of history
at a later period of life, and possessed an unusually
strong personality, were entirely swayed by the
most interesting of human passions&mdash;love. Lady
Katherine was literally “done to death” by her
infatuation for the young Earl of Hertford, the
eldest son of that Protector Somerset who suffered
death under Edward VI. The feline cruelty with
which Queen Elizabeth tormented Lady Katherine,
after the clandestine marriage with her lover
was revealed, called forth the freely expressed
condemnation of Chief Secretary Cecil, who
denounced his royal mistress’s harshness in no
measured terms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that Lady Willoughby d’Eresby, one
of the faithful attendants on Katherine of Aragon,
was so infuriated by Henry VIII’s courtship and
marriage with Anne Boleyn, that she pronounced
a terrible curse upon that wretched queen and the
infant Elizabeth. If, through her intercession
or incantations, she contrived to induce some evil
spirit to inspire Henry VIII to make his famous
but ill-considered Will, she certainly succeeded
in adding very considerably to the discomfort of
his celebrated daughter, who, during all her life,
had to experience the consequences of an ill-judged
testament, whereby Henry VIII, by passing
over the legitimate claim to the succession, of
his grandniece, Mary Queen of Scots, the descendant
of his eldest sister, Margaret Tudor, widow of
James IV of Scotland, in favour of the heirs of his
youngest sister, Mary Tudor, Queen of France and
Duchess of Suffolk, opened a very Pandora’s box,
full of more or less genuine claimants, after
Elizabeth’s death, to the English Throne. The
Spanish Ambassador enumerates a round dozen
of these, all of whom, with the exception of Mary
Stuart and Lady Katherine Grey, he describes as
more or less incompetent place-seekers, not worth
the butter on their bread, but who clamoured to
obtain the queen’s recognition of what they
believed to be their legal rights, and thereby
added greatly to the general confusion. Of these
claimants, Lady Katherine Grey was by far the
most important, her right to the Crown being
not only based on two Royal Wills&mdash;those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
Henry VIII and Edward VI<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;but, moreover,
ratified by a special Act of Parliament. She
therefore played a more conspicuous part in the
politics of the early years of Elizabeth’s reign than
is generally known, and, as a matter of fact, was
rarely out of the queen’s calculations. In the
first year of her reign, Elizabeth, wishing to be on
the best of terms with her young cousins, not
only admitted them to her privy chamber, but
went so far as to recognize Lady Katherine as her
legitimate successor, and even proposed to adopt
her, calling her, in public, her “daughter.” For
all this, there was no love lost between the queen
and the princess. Lady Katherine, who had been
intimate with the Countess of Feria, an Englishwoman
by birth, and a close friend of Queen
Mary, was strongly prejudiced against the Princess
Elizabeth, who, she had been assured, was no
daughter of Henry VIII, but a mere result of Anne
Boleyn’s intimacy with Smeaton the musician.
Notwithstanding, therefore, the queen’s advances,
on more than one occasion Lady Katherine Grey,
according to Quadra, the Spanish Ambassador,
answered Elizabeth disrespectfully. It was not,
however, until after the news of the clandestine
marriage between Lady Katherine Grey and the
Earl of Hertford reached her majesty, that she
began to persecute the wretched girl and her
husband, by sending them to the Tower&mdash;not,
indeed, to “dungeons damp and low,” but to fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
comfortable apartments, worthy of their high station,
for which the earl, at least, had to pay handsomely.
When, thanks to the carelessness or connivance
of Sir Edward Warner, the lieutenant, the
offending couple were allowed occasionally to meet,
and Lady Katherine eventually gave birth to two
sons, Elizabeth’s fury knew no bounds, and the
young mother had to undergo an awful and lifelong
penance as the result of her imprudence.
That Elizabeth had good cause to object to the
introduction into this world of a male successor,
became unpleasantly apparent some ten years
later, when the two boys were put forward as
claimants to her Throne, and thereby came very
near involving England in an ugly civil war.</p>

<p>The misfortunes of her elder sister do not seem
to have impressed Lady Mary Grey, on whom the
Crown devolved, according to the Wills of Henry
VIII and Edward VI, in the event of Lady
Katherine dying without issue. She was a dwarf,
and married secretly Mr. Thomas Keyes, the
“giant” Sergeant-Porter of Whitehall Palace,
who “stood seven feet without his shoes.” When
Elizabeth received the news of this “outrage”
on the part of the youngest of the sisters Grey,
her resentment was truly dreadful, though her indignation,
in this instance, was almost justifiable,
since there is nothing a great sovereign dislikes
more than that any members of the royal family
should expose themselves to ridicule. Lady Mary,
by her unequal marriage, had dragged the great
name of Tudor into the mire, and had rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
herself the laughing-stock of Europe! Elizabeth
adopted in this case the same unpleasant treatment
which she had administered to the recalcitrant
Lady Katherine; but, fortunately for the little
Lady Mary, Mr. Keyes died “of his torments,” at
an early stage of proceedings, and his widow,
having promised never to repeat her offence, by
re-marrying with an ordinary mortal, let alone
with a dwarf or a “giant,” was permitted to
spend the rest of her short life in peace and
plenty.</p>

<p>The character of Elizabeth does not shine for
its wisdom or kindliness in these pages; and some
incidental information concerning the mysterious
fate of Amy Robsart, Leicester’s first wife, tends
to prove that “our Eliza” was perfectly well
aware of what was going on at Cumnor Hall,
where, it will be remembered, the fair heroine of
Scott’s magnificent novel, <i>Kenilworth</i>, died “of
a fall downstairs,” which, at the time, was not
generally considered accidental. The callous
manner in which the queen announced this
accident&mdash;if accident it was&mdash;to the Spanish
Ambassador, is full of significance. Meeting him
one day in a corridor at Hampton Court, she said
to him very lightly, and in Italian: “The Lady
Amy, the Lord Robert’s wife, has fallen downstairs
and broken her neck.” A few days earlier the
queen had asked the ambassador whether he
thought there would be any harm in her marrying
her servant, meaning Dudley. He ventured to
remind her that there was an impediment to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
scheme, as the Lord Robert’s wife was then still
living. This impediment was soon removed!</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s openly expressed passion for the
future Earl of Leicester, who was Lady Katherine
Grey’s brother-in-law, damaged her reputation
throughout Europe, and even jeopardized her
Throne. The French Ambassador informs his
sovereign that “the Queen of England is mad on
the subject of the Lord Robert,” “she cannot
live without him,” “their rooms communicate.”
“I could tell your Majesty,” says the Spanish
representative at our Court, in a letter to Philip II,
“things about the Queen and the Lord Robert
which baffle belief, but I dare not do so in a letter.”
Strange to relate, however, no sooner was Amy
Robsart dead, than Elizabeth’s behaviour to the
Lord Robert, as he was generally called, underwent
a considerable change. She was willing to
retain him as a lover, but, after what had happened,
she was too frightened of possible consequences, to
accept him as a husband. It was only the beauty
of his person that captivated the queen: otherwise,
she recognized him to be what he really
was&mdash;a fool. “You cannot trust the Lord
Robert,”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> she once complained to the French
Ambassador, “any further than you see him.
Il est si bête.” She was perfectly right, for,
although she was perhaps never aware of the fact,
the Spanish State Papers reveal that at one time
Robert Dudley<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was actually in correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
through the Spanish Ambassador, with Philip II,
to obtain his approval of the following astounding
scheme, which, in abbreviated form, stands
thus: “The Lord Robert is to marry the Queen,
and, with Philip’s aid, they are to become
Catholics, and work for the reconciliation of
England to the Church, and the interests of
Spain.” Comment is needless!</p>

<p>The biographies of the two princesses, Katherine
and Mary Grey, are preceded by a few chapters
dealing with Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk,
and Mary Tudor, their grandfather and grandmother.
I have published these chapters, because
they seem to me to complete the history of this
strange family, and enable me to place before my
readers a subject never before, I believe, treated
in detail: that of the remarkable series of marriages
of Charles Brandon, who, at the time that he was
courting his king’s sister, had two wives living,
one of whom, the Lady Mortimer, was destined
to give him considerable trouble, and to vex his
spirit and that of his consort not a little. I think
I may claim to be the first writer on Tudor topics
and times who has been able to determine who
was this Lady Mortimer, Brandon’s first wife,
and to trace her very interesting pedigree to a
singular source. The story of Charles Brandon
and of his clandestine marriage with Mary Tudor
has been frequently related, and, indeed, it forms
the subject of one of the last essays ever written
by Major Martin Hume. Brandon’s earlier
adventures, however, have entirely escaped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
attention of historians, and are only alluded to in
a casual manner in most volumes on this subject.
Brandon had a very interesting and complex
personality, and the strange resemblance which
existed between him and his master, King Henry
VIII, forms not the least singular feature in his
romantic career. This resemblance was not only
physical, but moral. So great was it, from the
physical point of view, that certain of his portraits
are often mistaken for those of King Henry, to
whom, however, he was not even remotely connected
by birth. As to his moral character; his
marriages&mdash;he had four wives, whilst a fifth lady,
Baroness Lisle, was “contracted to him”&mdash;tend
to prove that either Henry VIII influenced his
favourite, or the favourite influenced his master,
especially in matters matrimonial.</p>

<p>A brief account of Lady Eleanor Brandon and
her heirs closes this volume, which I hope will
receive from the public as indulgent and kindly
a reception as did the story of Lady Jane Grey
(<i>The Nine-days’ Queen</i>), of which the celebrated
M. T. de Wyzewa, in a lengthy review in
the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, did me the honour of
saying that “Jamais encore, je crois, aucun
historien n’a reconstitué avec autant de relief et
de couleur pittoresque le tableau des intrigues
ourdies autour du trône du vieil Henri VIII et de
son pitoyable successeur, Edouard VI.”</p>

<p>It is my duty to state that I submitted the
manuscript of this book for the consideration of
the late Major Martin Hume, who had already done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
me the honour of editing my previous work, on
Lady Jane Grey, for which he supplied an Introduction
on the foreign policy of England during
the reign of Edward VI and the “nine-days’
reign,” possibly one of the most brilliant essays
on Tudor times he ever wrote. He was so much
interested in the present volume, that he promised
to write for it a similar introductory chapter;
but, unfortunately, a few weeks after this kind
offer of assistance was made, I received the sad
news of his sudden death. Major Martin Hume,
was, therefore, unable to carry his promise into
effect; but in a letter which he wrote to me at an
earlier period of our agreeable correspondence,
he indicated to me several sources of information,
of which I have gratefully availed myself.</p>

<p>The loss that historical literature sustained by
the death of Major Hume was far greater than the
general public, I think, realizes. He was a past-master
in Tudor lore and history, and the future
will, I trust, accord him that high position amongst
our historians to which his work on the Spanish or
Simancas State Papers should alone entitle him.
In paying this, my poor tribute, to his memory
as an historian, I can only add my sincere expression
of profound regret at his loss as a personal
friend.</p>

<p>In this volume&mdash;as well as in the previous one
on Lady Jane Grey&mdash;I received considerable
assistance, in the earlier stages of its compilation,
from the celebrated Dr. Gairdner, and from
my deeply regretted friend, the late Dr. Garnett.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
I wish to acknowledge my debt of gratitude to these
gentlemen; and to renew my thanks to the authorities
of the Record Office, the Bodleian Library,
and other libraries, public and private, for their
unvarying courtesy.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I desire to express my appreciation
of Mrs. Wright-Biddulph’s kindness in allowing
me to publish in this work a reproduction of her
unique portrait of Lady Katherine Grey. Lord
Leconfield, likewise, gave me permission to reproduce
several of the portraits in his magnificent
collection at Petworth, but, unfortunately, his
courteous offer came too late. None the less it
merits acknowledgment in these pages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The following brief account of Henry VIII’s Will
may aid the reader in understanding the complications to
which it gave rise. By this famous testament (dated 26th of
December 1546 and revoking all his previous Wills), King
Henry VIII provided that, in case he himself had no other
children by his “beloved wife Katherine [Parr] or any other
wives he might have thereafter,” and in the event of his only
son, Edward [afterwards King Edward VI], who was to be
his immediate successor, dying childless, that prince was to
be succeeded by his eldest sister, Princess Mary; and if she,
in turn, proved without offspring, she was to be succeeded
by her sister, King Henry’s younger daughter, Elizabeth.
Failing heirs to that princess, the Crown was to pass to the
Lady Jane Grey and her sisters, Katherine and Mary Grey,
successively, these being the daughters of Henry’s eldest
niece, the Lady Frances Brandon, Marchioness of Dorset.
In the event of the three sisters Grey dying without issue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
the Throne was to be occupied successively by the children
of the Lady Frances’s sister, the King’s other niece, the Lady
Eleanor Brandon, Countess of Cumberland. The Scotch
succession, through Henry’s eldest sister, Margaret Tudor,
Dowager Queen of Scotland, was set aside, and the name of
the young Queen of Scots [Mary Stuart] omitted from the
Will, preference being given to the Ladies Grey, the daughters
of Henry’s niece, because he hoped that the betrothal of
Mary Stuart, then only six years of age, to his son Edward,
might be arranged, and the desired union of England and
Scotland brought about in a natural manner. It is curious
that Henry’s nieces, the Ladies Frances and Eleanor, are not
named in the Will as possible successors to the Crown, although
their children are. Probably the King thought that, considering
the number of claimants in the field, both ladies
would be dead, in the course of nature, long before they could
be called upon to occupy the Throne.</p>

<p>In 1553 the Duke of Northumberland, then all powerful,
induced Edward VI, in the last weeks of his reign, to make a
Will, in which he set aside the Princesses Mary and Elizabeth,
his sisters, even stigmatizing them as bastards, and thus
reversing his father’s testament; and named Lady Jane Grey,
his cousin, and in default of her, her sisters Katherine and
Mary Grey, as his immediate and legitimate successors. The
consequences of this unfortunate “Devise,” as it is called,
were, as all the world knows, fatal to the Lady Jane and her
family.</p>

<p>As the result of these two Royal Wills, the principal claimants
to the Crown on Elizabeth’s death were, therefore, at the
beginning of her reign, the following: firstly, Mary Queen of
Scots, and her son, afterwards James I, who may be described
as the legitimate pretenders; secondly, the Lady Margaret
Lennox, step-sister to the Queen of Scots, and her two sons
Darnley and Charles Lennox, and, eventually, the latter’s
daughter, Arabella Stuart; thirdly, the Lady Katherine Grey
and her two sons, and finally, in the event of their deaths,
their aunt, the Lady Mary Grey. In case of all these princes
and princesses leaving no issue, there remained the children
and grandchildren of the Lady Frances’s sister, the Lady
Eleanor Brandon, Countess of Cumberland, one of whom,
at least, Fernando Strange, rendered himself and his claims
distinctly troublesome to Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The queen had, moreover, to contend with the heirs of
the Plantagenets, the members of the royal house of Pole,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>who, in the person of the Earl of Huntingdon, hoped, at one
time, to dethrone the queen, and, with the assistance of the
ultra-Protestant party, reign in her stead.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="cxxiii" id="cxxiii">THE ORIGIN OF THE HOUSE OF TUDOR</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> amazing marriage of Katherine of Valois,
widow of Henry V, with Owen Tudor, possibly
accounts for much that was abnormal in the
character of their royal descendants of the redoubted
House of Tudor. The queen dowager
was the daughter of the mad King Charles VI
of France and of his licentious consort, Isabeau
of Bavaria&mdash;bad blood, indeed; and Owen was
a mere soldier of fortune. In his grandson Henry
VII’s day, a goodly pedigree was discovered for
him, which set forth that far from being a “mean
born pup,” as was popularly reported, Owen
was descended from Kenan, son of Coel, who
was king of Britain, and brother of Helen,
the mother of Constantine the Great. As to
Owen ap Merideth ap Twydder or Tudor, good
old Sandford affirms that “the Meanness of his
Estate was recompensated by the Delicacy of
his Person, so absolute in all the Lineaments of
his Body, that the only Contemplation of it might
make a Queen forget all other Circumstances”&mdash;which
it did! Stowe, who lived near enough to
those times to receive direct tradition concerning
this brave soldier, says, in his <i>Annals</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
he was “as ignorant as any savage.” Tall beyond
the average, the founder of the House of Tudor
carried himself with “a perfect grace.” He was
well featured, with hair that was curly and
“yellow as gold.” At an entertainment given
in 1423, and attended, notwithstanding her recent
bereavement, by the widowed queen, this Adonis,
while in the act of executing an intricate pirouette,
fell at the royal lady’s feet. Whether the
passion kindled by this ludicrous accident was
reciprocated, we are not told; but so ardent
was it, on Katherine’s part, at least, that she soon
afterwards clandestinely married the handsome
Welshman.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span></p>

<p>The enemies of the House of Tudor averred
that this secret marriage never really took place,
and it is a singular fact that no allusion whatever
is made to it in the hearse verse originally placed
over the tomb of Queen Katherine in Westminster
Abbey, and quoted in full in the contemporary
Chronicle of William of Worcester. But when
Henry VII became king, this inscription was
removed and another hearse verse, containing the
following significant lines, was substituted and
hung over his grandmother’s monument:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq6i p1">“Of Owen Tudor after this,<br />
The next son Edmund was,</p>
<p class="ppn6i">O Katherine, a renowned Prince,<br />
That did in Glory pass.</p>
<p class="ppn6i">Henry the Seventh, a Britain Pearl,<br />
A Gem of England’s Joy,</p>
<p class="ppn6i">A peerless Prince was Edmund’s Son,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>A good and gracious Roy.</p>
<p class="ppn6i">Therefore a happy Wife this was,<br />
A happy Mother pure,</p>
<p class="ppn6i">Thrice happy Child, but Grandam she,<br />
More than Thrice happy sure.”</p>

<p class="p1">For more than seven years, during which time
she gave birth to four children, the queen’s household
observed profound secrecy with respect to
her marriage&mdash;a fact which honours the fidelity
and discretion of its members.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these precautions, Duke
Humphrey of Gloucester, who was regent during
the minority of Henry VI, suspected the existence
of something unusual, and, according to Sir
Edward Coke,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> forthwith framed a statute that
“anyone who should dare to marry a queen dowager
of these realms without the consent of king
and council should be considered an outlaw and
a traitor.” Spies were placed about the queen;
but they either failed to discover anything unusual,
or were bribed to secrecy: for the fact of
the clandestine marriage was not really established
until shortly before her death. When it became
known, there must have been a terrible storm
in the royal circle, for Owen was arrested and
sent to Newgate, and the queen banished to
Bermondsey Abbey,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> where she died, six months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
later, on January 1, 1447, of a lingering illness
and a broken heart. Katherine de la Pole, Abbess
of Barking, took charge of the children, but she
did not reveal their existence to Henry VI till
some months after the queen’s decease, and
then “only because she needed money for their
sustenance.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>London Chronicle</i>, a most
valuable contemporary document, thus relates
the subsequent misadventures of the unfortunate
Owen: “This year [1447] one Owen Twyder,
who had followed Henry V to France, broke out
of Newgate at searching time, the which Owen
had privately married Queen Katherine and had
four children by her, unknown to the common
people until she was dead and buried.” Owen
Tudor was three times imprisoned for marrying
the queen, but each time he contrived to baffle
the vigilance of his gaolers, only, however, to be
promptly recaptured. As years went by, he came
to be received into a certain measure of favour
by his stepson, the king; and he fought so valiantly
for the Lancastrian cause at Northampton, in
1460, that the king made “his well beloved
squire Owen Tudyer” [<i>sic</i>] keeper of his parks
in Denbigh, Wales.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Later on, at the battle of Mortimer’s Cross,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
he again unsheathed his Agincourt sword in the
Lancastrian cause, but, being taken prisoner by
Edward IV, he was beheaded in Hereford market
place. Many years later, by a strange and
romantic concatenation of events, Edward’s eldest
daughter, Elizabeth, married the fallen Owen’s
grandson, Henry VII, thereby becoming the first
queen of England of the Tudor line, and the great-grandmother
of the Ladies Jane, Katherine and
Mary Grey.</p>

<p>There was, it seems, a rugged grandeur about
Owen Tudor, which stood him in lieu of gentle
accomplishments. The physical power, persistent
obstinacy and bluff address of his royal descendants
may indeed have been derived from
this fine old warrior; and from him surely it
was that they inherited the magnificent personal
appearance, the lofty stature, the fair complexion
and leonine locks, that distinguished them from
the dark but equally splendid Plantagenets.
May we not also justly conclude that their violent
passions were an inheritance transmitted to
them by the amorous Katherine and her vicious
mother?&mdash;passions which played so fateful a
part in the tragic stories of Lady Katherine and
Lady Mary Grey&mdash;the two younger sisters of the
unfortunate “Nine-days’ Queen,” Lady Jane
Grey.</p>

<p>Soon after Queen Katherine’s decease, Henry VI
brought his Tudor brethren into the royal circle.
When the eldest, Edmund of Hadham, grew to
manhood, he created him Earl of Richmond
(November 23, 1452), with precedence of all
other earls. This stalwart nobleman married
the dwarfish Princess Margaret Plantagenet,
Countess of Beaufort, great-granddaughter of
John of Gaunt by his last wife Catherine Swynford,
and daughter and heiress of the last Duke of
Somerset of the first creation. He was one of
the pillars of the Lancastrian party, lending
great help at the temporary restoration of
Henry VI; afterwards, under Edward IV, he
was compelled, with other Lancastrians, to seek
safety in Brittany. He died shortly after his
return to England, within a year of his marriage,
leaving a son, who succeeded to his father’s title
of Earl of Richmond, and eventually became
King Henry VII. Edmund’s next brother, Jasper
of Hatfield, so called from the place of his birth,
was raised at the same time to the rank of Earl
of Pembroke. He was with his father at the
battle of Mortimer’s Cross; but escaped, and later,
at the accession of Henry VII, he was created
Duke of Bedford in the place of George Nevill,
elder brother of the famous “Kingmaker,” whose
titles and lands were confirmed in his favour. He
died young in 1456 and was buried in St. David’s
Cathedral. He never married, but left an illegitimate
daughter, who became the wife of William
Gardiner, a citizen of London. Stephen Gardiner,
Bishop of Winchester, was reputed to be their
son. Owen, third son of Katherine of Valois and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
Owen Tudor, embraced the religious life and lived
a monk, at Westminster, into the first half of the
sixteenth century. Their only daughter&mdash;who was
blessed with the curious name of Tacina, and whose
existence is ignored by most historians&mdash;married
Lord Grey de Wilton, an ancestor of the ill-fated
subjects of this book.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that whereas most of the
Tudor Princes were very tall, several of them,
thanks to a well-known law of atavism, reverted
to the tiny type of their ancestress, Margaret
Plantagenet. Mary I was a small woman, and
the three sisters Grey were not much above the
height of average-sized dwarfs.</p>

<p class="pc4 elarge">CHARLES BRANDON, DUKE
OF SUFFOLK</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a><br /><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c3" id="c3">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="pch">CLOTH OF FRIEZE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a remarkable fact that, although Charles
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, was, after Thomas
More, Wolsey and the king himself, the most conspicuous
personage at the court of Henry VIII,
no authoritative biography of him exists, unless
indeed it be a short, but very unimportant, monograph
(written in Latin, at the end of the sixteenth
century) now in the King’s Library at the
British Museum. Suffolk outlived nearly all his
principal contemporaries, except the king and
the Duke of Norfolk, and his career, therefore,
runs almost parallel with that of Henry VIII,
whom he attended in nearly every event of importance,
from boyhood to death. Brandon
predeceased the king by only a few months. In
person, he bore so striking a resemblance to
Henry, that the French, when on bad terms with
us, were wont to say that he was his master’s
bastard brother. The two men were of the same
towering height, but Charles was, perhaps, the
more powerful; at any rate, King Henry had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
good cause, on one occasion, to admit the fact,
for Brandon overthrew and slightly injured him
in a wrestling match at Hampton Court. Both
king and duke were exceedingly fair, and had
the same curly, golden hair, the same steel-grey
eyes, planted on either side of an aquiline nose,
somewhat too small for the breadth of a very large
face. In youth and early manhood, owing to the
brilliancy of their pink-and-white complexions,
they were universally considered extremely
handsome, but with the advent of years they
became abnormally stout, and vainly tried to
conceal their fat, wide cheeks, and double chins,
with beards and whiskers. A French chronicler,
speaking of Charles Brandon at the time that he
was in Paris for the marriage of Mary Tudor to
Louis XII, says he had never seen so handsome a
man, or one of such manly power who possessed so
delicate a complexion&mdash;<i>rose et blanc tout comme
une fille</i>. And yet he was not the least effeminate,
for of all the men of his day, he was the
most splendid sportsman, the most skilful in the
tilt-yard, and the surest with the arrow. He
danced so lightly and so gracefully that to
see him was a sight in which even Henry VIII,
himself an elegant dancer, delighted.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, so many physical advantages
were not allied to an equal number of virtues;
and here again, the resemblance between King
Henry and his bosom friend is extraordinary.
Both were equally cruel, selfish and unscrupulous,
and both entertained the same loose ideas as to
the sanctity of marriage&mdash;with this difference,
however, that whereas King Henry usually divorced
one wife before he took another, Charles
had two wives living at one and the same time,
from neither of whom was he properly divorced!
What is most singular, too, is that he ventured to
marry the king’s sister whilst his first wife was
still living, and not as yet legally separated from
him, whereby he might easily have been hauled
before a justice as a bigamist, and his offspring
by a princess of the blood royal of England, and
dowager queen of France to boot, been declared
illegitimate.</p>

<p>In addition to his great strength and exceptional
ability as a commander, both on land and
sea, Suffolk possessed a luxuriant imagination,
which delighted in magnificent pageantry. In
the halcyon days of Henry’s reign, long before
the fires of Smithfield had shed their lurid glow
over the city, Suffolk and his master devised
sports and pastimes, masques and dances, to
please the ladies.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Once he entered the tilt-yard
dressed as a penitent, in a confraternity robe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cowl of crimson velvet, his horse draped in cardinal-coloured
satin. Assuming a humble attitude,
he approached the pavilion in which sat the king
and Queen Katherine, and in a penitential whine,
implored her grace’s leave to break a lance in
her honour. This favour being granted, he threw
back his cloak, and appeared, a blaze of cloth
of gold, of glittering damascened armour and
sparkling jewels, to break sixteen lances in honour
of the queen. Again, when Queen Mary was his
bride, and the court went a-maying at Shooters
Hill, he devised a sort of pastoral play, and with
Jane Grey’s paternal grandfather, Thomas, Marquis
of Dorset, disguised himself and his merry men
as palmers, in gowns of grey satin with scallop-shells
of pure gold and staves of silver. The
royal guests having been duly greeted, the palmers
doffed their sober raiment and appeared, garbed
in green and gold, as so many Robin Hoods.
They then conducted their Majesties to a glade
where there were “pastimes and daunces,” and,
doubtless, abundant wine and cakes. Much later
yet, Brandon went, in the guise of a palmer, with
Henry VIII, to that memorable ball given by
Wolsey at Whitehall, at which Anne Boleyn won
the heart of the most fickle of our kings.</p>

<p>The last half of the fourteenth century witnessed
the beginning of the decline of feudalism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in England. The advance of education, and
consequently of civilization, had by this time
largely developed the commercial and agricultural
resources of the country, and the yeoman class,
with that of the country gentry, had gradually
come into being. At the Conquest, the majority
of the lands owned by the Saxons&mdash;rebels to
Norman force&mdash;were confiscated and handed over
to the Conqueror’s greater generals: to such men
as William, Earl of Warren, or Quarenne, who
seated himself in East Anglia, having, as his principal
Norfolk fortress, Castleacre Castle, on the
coast, not far from East Dereham. Its picturesque
ruins still tower above those of the magnificent
priory that the great William de Warren
raised, “to the honour of God and Our Lady,” for
monks of the Cluniac branch of the Benedictine
Order. This Earl of Warren, who was overlord
of a prodigious number of manors and fiefs in
East Anglia, numbered, among the bonny men
who came out of Picardy and Normandy in his
train, two stalwart troopers: one haled from
Boulogne-on-the-Sea, so tradition says&mdash;and is
not tradition unwritten history?&mdash;and was known
as “Thomas of Boulogne”; he settled at Sale,
near Aylsham, in Norfolk, and was the progenitor
of the Boleyns or Bullens, whose surname is an
evident corruption of <i>de Boulogne</i>; the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
dropped his French patronym, whatever it was,
and assumed the name of Brandon, after a little
West Suffolk border town, in the immediate
vicinity of the broad and fertile lands he had
acquired.</p>

<p>These Brandons, then, had lived on their farm
near Brandon for about four centuries, deriving,
no doubt, a very considerable income from the
produce of their fields and from their cattle.
It is certain that they sent several members of
their family to the Crusades; that one of them
followed the Black Prince to Poitiers, and that
yet another, a trooper, it is true, died on the
field of Agincourt.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Somewhere in the last quarter
of the fourteenth century, William, the then head
of the family, apprenticed his son Geoffrey to a
rich mercer of Norwich, a great commercial centre
in those days, next to London and Bristol in
importance, and doing what we should now call
a “roaring trade” with Flanders, and through
Flanders, with Venice and Florence, and even with
the East. This Norwich Brandon having made
a fortune, was seized with an ambition to attain
still greater wealth and station for his son and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
heir William; and hence it came about, that near
the time King Henry VI ascended the throne,
young Brandon arrived in London, apprenticed
to a firm of mercers established near Great
St. Helen’s, Bishopsgate Street. He was a pushing,
shrewd, energetic, and very unscrupulous knave,
who soon acquired great influence in the city
and amassed corresponding wealth. Finally, he
became sheriff, and was knighted by Henry VI.
He purchased a large property in Southwark, and
built himself a mansion, later known as Suffolk
Court. During the Wars of the Roses he allied himself
at first with the Yorkists, and lent Edward IV
considerable sums of money, which, according
to Paston, that monarch dishonestly refused to repay.
This drove William to cast his fortunes with
the Lancastrians and largely assist Henry VII,
then simply Earl of Richmond, both with money
and men, and so was held in high esteem by
that monarch till his death, in the twelfth year
of Henry’s reign. William Brandon married
Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Wingfield of
Letheringham, whose mother was the daughter
and co-heir of Sir Robert Goushall, the third
husband of the dowager Duchess of Norfolk, widow
of the first duke, who, dying in exile in Venice,
was buried in the magnificent church of San
Giovanni e Paolo. Even thus early, we see a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Brandon, the great-grandson of a Suffolk farmer,
connecting himself with the noble houses of
Wingfield, Fitzalan and Howard.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>At one time this gentleman was on very intimate
terms with the renowned Sir John Paston,
whose <i>Letters</i> throw so much light on the manners
and customs of the age in which he lived; but
the cronies fell out over some matter of business
connected with Paston’s claim to the possession
of Caistairs Castle, in which transaction, Paston
declares, Brandon behaved like a blackguard&mdash;indeed,
King Edward, to whom appeal was made,
listed him as a “lyre.” During their intimacy,
Paston, possibly over a tankard of ale at a merry
dinner or supper party, had made some irreverent
and coarse remarks about her grace of Norfolk,
in the presence of Lady Brandon, who was the
duchess’s grand-daughter. He had poked fun
at the poor lady’s appearance when on the eve
of adding her tribute to the population. Paston
has recorded what he said, and it must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
confessed, that if Lady Brandon did repeat his
vulgar jest to her august relation, that lady had
every reason to feel indignant at such familiarity.</p>

<p>Whether it was repeated or not has never transpired,
so perhaps we may suppose Lady Brandon
was a prudent woman and kept her counsel. But
Paston wrote to his brother to ask if he thought
she might be trusted, or whether she was likely
to have made mischief by repeating his ill-timed
remarks to the duchess, her mother, adding a
“lye or two of her own to help it out.”</p>

<p>Sir William Brandon, eldest son of the first
William, and father of Charles Brandon, was never
knighted, although usually styled by courtesy
“Sir.” He married, when he was very young,
Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of Sir Henry
Bruyn, or Brown,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> by his wife, Elizabeth Darcy.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Sir William Brandon was standard-bearer to
Henry VII at Bosworth Field, and there lost his
life at the hand of Richard III, whilst gallantly
defending his royal patron. Henry proved his
gratitude by educating his only son, Charles, who,
by his marriage with Mary Tudor, became the
grandfather of Lady Jane Grey and her sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Katherine and Mary. Some historians have
confused King Henry’s standard-bearer with a
younger brother, Thomas Brandon, who married
Anne Fiennes, daughter of Lord Dacre and widow
of the Marquis of Berkeley, but had no children.
He looms large (in every sense of the word, being
of great height and bulk) in all the tournaments
and jousts held in honour of the marriage of
Katherine of Aragon with Prince Henry. He
died, a very wealthy man, at his London house,
Southwark Place, in 1502.</p>

<p>At four years of age the child Charles Brandon
became playfellow to Arthur, Prince of Wales;
but on the birth of the future Henry VIII, he was
transferred to the younger prince as his companion.
He may even have received his education
with Henry, from Bernard André, historian
and poet, or perhaps from Skelton, poet-laureate
to Henry VII, who, with Dr. Ewes, had a considerable
share in the instruction of the young
prince. But there is reason to believe that
Brandon, as a lad, did not spend so much time at
court as has been generally stated, for his letters,
phonetically spelt, in accordance with the fashion
of his time, prove him to have spoken with a
broad Suffolk accent; he must, therefore, have
passed a good deal of his youth at Brandon, on
the borders of Suffolk and Norfolk, where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
according to tradition, he was born. His letters,
although the worst written and spelt of his day,
are full, too, of East Anglianisms, which could
only have been picked up by a man in his position
through contact, in boyhood, with yokels and
country-folk in general.</p>

<p>Charles, who grew up to be a remarkably fine
youth, tall and “wondrous powerful,” began life
virtually as an attendant in the royal household,
though, as already stated, in due time he became
Henry’s principal favourite and confidant. When
little over twenty, he distinguished himself in a
sea-fight off Brest, and was sent by Wolsey to
join Henry VIII in his adventurous campaign
to Therouanne. At the famous battle of the
Spurs, he proved himself as brave a soldier as he
had already shown himself to be a doughty sailor;
but for all this merit he can scarcely be described
as an honest gentleman, especially where
ladies are concerned, and his matrimonial adventures
were not only strange and complicated, but
also exceedingly characteristic of the times in
which he lived. In 1505/6, Charles Brandon
became betrothed,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> <i>per verba de præsenti</i>, to a
young lady of good family, Anne Browne, third
daughter of Sir Anthony Binyon Browne, K.G.,
governor of Calais, and of his wife, the Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Lucy Nevill, daughter and co-heiress of John
Nevill, Marquis of Montagu, brother of the “Kingmaker,”
Richard, Earl of Warwick. In 1506/7
this contract was set aside and the young gentleman
married Margaret, the mature widow of Sir
John Mortimer of Essex<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> (will proved, 1505).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
And now came trouble. The Lady Mortimer,
<i>née</i> Nevill (probably rather a tedious companion
for so youthful a husband), was none other than
the aunt of his first <i>fiancée</i>, Anne Browne, her
sister being the Lady Lucy Nevill, who, as stated
above, was the wife of Sir Anthony Browne and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
mother of Anne. Brandon, therefore, probably
with the aid of Henry VIII, about 1507, after
having squandered a good deal of her fortune,
induced the Archdeacon of London (in compliance
with a papal bull) to declare his marriage
with Lady Mortimer null and void, on the grounds
that: Firstly, he and his wife were within the
second and third degrees of affinity; secondly,
that his wife and the lady to whom he was first
betrothed (Anne Browne) were within the prohibited
degrees of consanguinity&mdash;i.e. aunt and
niece; thirdly, that he was cousin once removed
to his wife’s former husband. After these proceedings,
he married, or rather re-married, in
1508/11, in “full court,” and in the presence of
a great gathering of relations and friends&mdash;and
not secretly, as usually stated&mdash;the aforesaid Anne
Browne, by whom he had two daughters, the
eldest being born so soon after wedlock as to give
rise to unpleasant gossip, probably started by
Lady Mortimer. Anne, Lady Brandon, did not
long survive her marriage, for she died in
1511/12; and in the following year (1513) her
widower made a third attempt at matrimony,
by a contract with his ward, the Lady Elizabeth
Grey, <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Lisle, who, born in
1503/4, was only ten years of age; but the negotiations
failed, though Brandon had been granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the viscounty of Lisle, which title he assumed
(May 15, 1513). As this lady absolutely refused
him, he surrendered the patent of the title of
Lisle in favour of Arthur Plantagenet, illegitimate
son of Edward IV and husband of Lady Elizabeth
Lisle, the aunt and co-heiress of the young lady
he had wished to make his bride, and who, being
free, gave her hand to Courtenay, Earl of Devon,
who presently became Marquis of Exeter. This
above-mentioned aunt, the other Lady Elizabeth,
had married, in 1495, Edmund Dudley, the
notorious minister of Henry VII, and became,
about 1502, mother of that John Dudley, Duke of
Northumberland, who proved so fatal to Lady
Jane Grey and her family.</p>

<p>Whilst he was still plodding through the labyrinth
of his matrimonial difficulties, early in 1513,
Charles Brandon was entrusted with a diplomatic
mission to Flanders, to negotiate a marriage between
Mary Tudor, the king’s youngest sister,
and the young Archduke Charles of Austria,
Infante of Spain, the most powerful and richest
prince in Europe. On this occasion he displayed
his majestic and graceful figure to such advantage
in the tilt-yard, that the demonstrative expressions
of admiration which escaped the proposed
bridegroom’s aunt, Drayton’s “blooming duchess,”
the most high and mighty Princess Margaret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Archduchess of Austria, dowager Duchess of
Savoy, and daughter of the Emperor Maximilian,
evoked sarcastic comment from the illustrious
company.</p>

<p>On Brandon’s return, Henry VIII, probably
with a view to facilitating a possible alliance
between his favourite and the dowager of Savoy,
to universal surprise and some indignation, created
his “well-beloved Charles Brandon,” Duke of
Suffolk, a title until quite recently held by the
semi-regal, but dispossessed house of de la Pole,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and further presented him with the vast territorial
apanage of that family, which included
Westhorpe Hall, near Bury St. Edmunds; Donnington
Castle, the inheritance of Chaucer’s granddaughter,
the first Duchess of Suffolk; Wingfield
Castle, in Suffolk; Rising Castle in Norfolk; and
Lethering Butley in Herefordshire.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>In the summer of 1513, while the king was
sojourning at Tournay, he received a visit from
the Archduke Charles of Castile and Austria, and
his aunt, the Dowager Duchess of Savoy, Regent
of the Netherlands. These august personages
came to congratulate the English monarch on
the capture of Tournay from their mutual enemy,
Louis XI of France. At this time the Austro-Spanish
archduke still hoped to secure the hand
of the King of England’s handsome sister, Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Tudor, who had accompanied her brother to
France. Henry did his best to ingratiate himself
with the regent, a handsome lady with a
foolish whimpering expression, who, if we may
judge her by her portrait in the Museum at Brussels,
was most apt to credit anything and everything
that flattered her fancy. The king and
his favourites, indeed, to amuse her, behaved less
like gentlemen than mountebanks. Henry danced
grotesquely before her and played on the giltrone,
the lute and the cornet for her diversion, and his
boon companions followed their master’s example
and exhibited their accomplishments as dancers
and musicians. The contemporary <i>Chronicle of
Calais</i> contains a most amusing account of the
way Henry and Charles made game of the poor
dowager, who betrayed her too evident partiality
for the latter. Brandon actually went so far on
one occasion as to steal a ring from her finger;
“and I took him to laugh,” says Margaret of
Savoy, describing this incident,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> “and said to
him that he was <i>un larron</i>&mdash;a thief&mdash;and that I
thought the king had with him led thieves out of his
country. This word <i>larron</i> he could not understand.”
So Henry had to be called in to explain it
to him. His Majesty next contrived a sort of love-scene
between the pair, in which he made Duchess
Margaret a very laughing-stock, by inducing her
to repeat after him in her broken English the
most appalling improprieties, the princess being
utterly ignorant of the meaning of the words she
was parroting. To lead her on, Suffolk, who was
not a good French scholar, made answer, at the
king’s prompting, to the princess’s extraordinary
declarations, in fairly respectable French. At
last, however, the good lady realized the situation,
and, rising in dudgeon, declared Brandon to be
“no gentleman and no match for her,”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and thus
he lost his chance, though he never lost, as we
shall presently see, the great lady’s friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>This silly prank on the English king’s part was,
no doubt, the final cause of the rupture of the
proposed alliance between Mary Tudor and the
Archduke Charles of Castile. Be this as it may,
it was at Tournay that Mary was reported to
have first fallen a victim to the blandishments of
Suffolk, who, while fooling the regent, was
covertly courting his dread patron’s sister. He
flattered himself that the king, loving him so
tenderly as a friend, would readily accept him
as a brother-in-law. In this he was mistaken.
Henry had other views for Princess Mary’s future;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and no sooner was the Austro-Spanish match
broken off,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> thanks to certain political intrigues
too lengthy and intricate to recapitulate here,
than he set to work to arrange a marriage between

<p class="pch">THE FRENCH MARRIAGE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> negotiations for this incongruous marriage,
which united, for the first time since the Norman
Conquest, a British princess to a French king,
proceeded very slowly, for Henry knew well that
his sister would reluctantly sacrifice her youth
to so ugly and sickly a bridegroom: thus, according
to the late Major Martin Hume, the first intimation
of the proposal Mary received was not
until after a tournament held at Westminster
on May 14, 1514.</p>

<p>This tournament, in the open space between the
ancient Palace and the Abbey, was magnificent
in the extreme. Never before had there been
seen in England so many silken banners, canopies,
and tents of cloth of silver and gold. Queen
Katherine of Aragon watched the tilting from a
pavilion of crimson damask, embroidered with
golden pomegranates, the emblems of her native
country. Beside her sat Princess Mary, a pink-and-white
beauty, with hair of amazing length
shimmering down her back, and held in position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
by a band of jewels that encircled her graceful
head. Behind the princess many great ladies
occupied the roomy chairs of state&mdash;the Countess
of Westmorland and her lovely Nevill daughters,
the Lady Paulet, the Lady of Exeter, the Lady
de Mowbray, the Duchess of Norfolk, the Lady
Elizabeth Boleyn, sister of the Duke of Norfolk
and mother of the future Queen Anne, the “old
Lady” of Oxford, and the Princess Margaret
Plantagenet, that fated Countess of Salisbury who
in after years was hacked to death by order of
her most affectionate nephew, King Henry VIII,
now in the full bloom of early manhood. There
was a great nodding of glittering hoods and rustling
of silken gowns, and whispering and tittering
amongst this bevy of high and mighty dames,
unto whom many a gallant knight and lordly
sire conveyed his homage and the latest gossip
of the day. Over the multi-coloured crowd fell
the golden haze of a lovely October afternoon.
Farther away from the throng of lords and ladies,
the hearty citizens of London pressed against the
barriers, whilst rich burghers, and British and
foreign merchants, with their wives and daughters,
filled the special seats allotted to them, that commanded
a finer view of the towers of Westminster
than did the richer canopies of the court folk.
Itinerant vendors of sweetmeats, apples, nuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and cakes, hawked their wares up and down the
free spaces, whilst ballad-mongers sang&mdash;or rather
shouted&mdash;their ditties, just as their descendants
do, whenever there is a show of sport or pastime
in our own day. Men and maidens cheered
lustily as knight after knight, armed <i>cap-à-pie</i>,
pranced his steed before the delighted spectators,
even as we parade our horses before the race
at Epsom, Sandown or Ascot.</p>

<p>The expressed hope was, of course, that the
English knights should vanquish the French noble
prisoners who had been set at liberty shortly before
the tilt, so that they might join in the sport.
The champions among them were the Duc
de Longueville and the Sire de Clermont. The
trumpets sounded, a hush fell upon the noisy
gathering, all eyes were turned in one direction,
as two stalwart champions entered the lists.
They were garbed as hermits, the one in a
black satin cloak with a hood, the other in a
white one. With all the punctilious observance
demanded by established rule and etiquette, these
hermits, who rode mighty chargers caparisoned in
silver mail, advanced towards the royal pavilion
and made obeisance. On a sudden, off fell their
cloaks and hoods, to reveal the two handsomest
men in Europe, to boot, Henry, King of England,
and Charles, Duke of Suffolk, clad from head to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
foot in silver armour, damascened in gold by
Venetian armourers. Long white plumes flowed
from the crests of their gilded helmets. Behind
the British champions rode two other fine fellows,
bearing standards on which figured in golden
letters the motto: “Who can hold that will
away?” On reading this motto, the fair bent,
the one to the other, to discuss its meaning. Did
it refer to the young King of Castile and Flanders;
or to the fact that Charles Brandon, as it was
whispered about, was venturing to raise his eyes
so high as to meet those of the Emperor Maximilian’s
daughter, Margaret of Austria? It was said,
too, that the Lady Mary, the king’s sister, liked
not the motto; for even then she had conceived
a wild though secret passion for the splendid son
of a Suffolk squire.</p>

<p>The English (God and St. George be praised!)
won the day; the Duc de Longueville was defeated
“right honourably,” and so, too, was the Sire
de Clermont. The silken kerchief, the gilded cup
and the wreath of laurel were for Charles Brandon;
and the princess, the Beauty Queen of the day,
presented them to him as he knelt before her.
Katherine of Aragon bestowed the second prize,
a cup of gold, on her husband, who had vanquished
Clermont.</p>

<p>Immediately after the jousts, Mary Tudor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
learnt, to her exasperation, that her hand was
destined, not for the Spanish prince, the future
Emperor Charles V, nor for the Suffolk gentleman,
but for the decrepit and doomed King of
France. She was too much of a Tudor to accept
her fate with meekness, and King Henry soon
found he had set himself a difficult task to conciliate
his sister, and obtain her consent to what
was even then considered a monstrous match.
She swore she would not marry his French
majesty, unless her brother gave her his solemn
promise that she should marry whom she listed
when she became a widow. The king answered
that, by God! she might do as she listed, if only
she pleased him this time. He urged that King
Louis was prematurely aged, and not likely,
so he had been told, to live many months.
Besides, he was passing rich, and the princess
would have more diamonds, pearls and rubies
than she had hairs on her head. Henry even appealed
to her patriotism. England needed peace;
the prolonged wars between France and England
had exhausted both, and it was deemed advisable
that the French should be made to understand,
by this happy event, that the enmity which had
existed so long had ceased at last. It was to be
a thorough <i>entente cordiale</i> on both sides. None
the less, when they got to know of it, both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
English and the French cracked many an indelicate
jest over this unnatural alliance. The
bride, it will be remembered, was still in her
teens, and beautiful: the bridegroom-elect was
fifty-three and looked twenty years older, the
most disfiguring of his complication of loathsome
diseases being, as we have seen, elephantiasis,
which had swollen his face and head so enormously
that when, on her arrival in France, Mary first
beheld her future consort, she drew back, with
an unconcealed cry of horror. For some days
Mary seemed obdurate, despite Henry’s promise
that, on the death of the French king, she might
marry whom she listed. But at last she allowed
her brother’s persuasive arguments to prevail,
so that, dazzled by the prospect of becoming the
richest and grandest princess in Europe, she finally,
but reluctantly, consented to marry King Louis.</p>

<p>The “treaty of marriage” between Louis XII
and Mary Tudor was signed at London by the
representatives of both parties on August 7
(1514); and the marriage by proxy, according to
the custom of the time, took place in the Grey
Friars’ Church at Greenwich, before Henry VIII,
Katherine of Aragon, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the
Bishops of Winchester and Durham, and others,
on August 13. The recently liberated Duc de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Longueville represented the French king, whereas
the Duke of Orleans gave the bride the ring;
afterwards the primate pronounced a brief panegyric
of the young queen’s virtues, and those of
her august spouse, whom he described as the
best and greatest prince in Europe.</p>

<p>The bride left England’s shores on October 2,
after a tearful leave-taking of her brother and
sister-in-law, King Henry and Queen Katherine.
The chronicles of those far-off times, ever delighting
in giving the minutest details, inform us that
she was “terrible sea-sick” before she arrived
at Boulogne, where a pious pageant had been
prepared to greet her. Above the drawbridge of
the port, suspended in mid-air, was a ship, painted
with garlands of the roses of England mingled
with the <i>fleur-de-lys</i> of France, and bearing the
inscription, <i>Un Dieu, Un Roy, Une Foy, Une
Loy</i>: “One God, One King, One Faith, One Law.”
In this ship stood a young girl&mdash;“dressed like the
Virgin Mary,” as the chronicler tells us&mdash;together
with two winged children, supposed to be angels.
The young lady represented Notre Dame de Boulogne,
the patroness of the city, and bore the
civic gift, destined for the princess, consisting of
a silver swan, whose neck opened, to disclose a
golden heart weighing sixty <i>écus</i>. So violently
raged the storm, that the heavy vessel, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of riding gracefully into the harbour, stuck on
a sandbank, and the future Queen of France,
dripping with sea-water, had to be carried
ashore by Sir Christopher Gervase. On reaching
land, she was met by the Heir Presumptive
of her new dominions, François, Duc de Valois,
the Dukes of Alençon and Bourbon, and the
Counts de Vendôme, de Saint-Pol, and de Guise,
supported by the Abbots of Notre Dame and of
St. Wulmer, accompanied by their monks wearing
copes, and bearing, enclosed in gold and silver
shrines, all the relics from their respective churches.
In the presence of this goodly company, the ship
containing the aforesaid representative of Our
Lady of Boulogne was lowered to the ground,
and the young lady addressed the princess “en
rhétoricque,” otherwise French verse, welcoming
her to Boulogne, and presenting her with the city’s
gift. Mary then proceeded to the Church of
Notre Dame, and after praying there awhile, she
was, so says our chronicler, “agreeably occupied
in admiring all the rich and royal offerings that
formed the principal attraction of the Church.”
And gorgeous and wonderful indeed must it
have been, before the vandal greed of King
Henry’s troops had sacked the shrine. The
Treasury contained nearly a hundred gold and
silver reliquaries, eighteen great silver images,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
most of them containing relics, “eleven hearts
and a great number of arms and legs, both in
gold and silver” (votive offerings), twenty dresses
and twelve mantles of very precious stuffs, “for
the use of the holy Image.” The altar of the
Blessed Virgin was especially magnificent. Seven
lamps, four in silver and the rest of gold, burnt
incessantly before the Madonna, who held in one
hand a golden heart, whilst the other supported
a figure of the Infant Jesus, who clasped in His
chubby hand a bouquet of “golden flowers,”
amongst which was “a carbuncle of a prodigious
bigness”; the pillars and columns round this
altar were sheathed in “blades of silver”: “in
short,” says the chronicler, “everything which
was in this chapel could challenge comparison
with the richest and most renowned objects that
antiquity ever had.” Such was the splendour
that enchanted and bewildered our Princess
Mary, who after offering to Our Lady of Boulogne
a gift consisting of “a great arm of silver, enamelled
with the arms of France and England, and weighing
eight marcs,” proceeded on her way to Abbeville,
near which city she was met, in the forest
of Ardres, by King Louis, mounted on a charger
and attended by a glittering train of lords and
attendants.</p>

<p>To the young and beautiful Mary, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
only just recovered from a violent sea-sickness,
this first meeting with her future lord and master
must indeed have been painful. As she afterwards
admitted, she had never before seen a
human being so horribly ugly. It is not therefore
to be wondered at that she should have uttered
the exclamation of horror above mentioned.
King Louis, for his part, was in the best of
humours; never merrier. He was very plainly
dressed, and was evidently bent on correcting, by
his munificence and good temper, whatever unfavourable
impression might be created by his
unfortunate appearance. Before arriving at the
place of meeting, Princess Mary had changed her
travelling gown for a weighty robe covered with
goldsmith’s work “like unto a suit of armour.”
So awkward and stiff was this costume, that
when the princess, in accordance with etiquette,
attempted to descend from her litter to bend the
knee before her royal spouse, she found she was
unable to do so, and was in great distress until
the deformed king gallantly begged her not to
attempt so complicated a manœuvre, and won a
grateful smile from his embarrassed bride.</p>

<p>The marriage took place on Monday, October 9
(1514), at Abbeville, in the fine old Church of
St. Wolfran, and is one of the most gorgeous
functions recorded of those pageant-loving times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Something mysterious must have happened at
Abbeville, for, according to the Bishop of Asti,
the marriage was consummated by proxy&mdash;a
weird ceremony in which the Marquis de Rothelin
(representing King Louis), fully dressed in a red
suit, except for one stocking, hopped into the
bride’s bed and touched her with his naked leg;
and the “marriage was then declared consummated.”
Possibly, considering the rickety state
of his health, this was all the married life, in its
more intimate form, that, fortunately, Mary Tudor
ever knew so long as Louis XII lived. As an
earnest of his affection, however, the sickly king
presented his spouse with a collection of jewels
a few days after the marriage, amongst these being
“a ruby almost two inches long and valued at
ten thousand marks.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, there had been some unpleasantness
between the French monarch and the
Earl of Worcester, the English ambassador,
about the presence in France of one of the queen’s
maids, Mistress Joan Popincourt. The question
of her fitness to accompany the princess was
first raised before Mary left our shores, to reach
its culminating point whilst the new queen was
resting at Boulogne, at which time King Louis
(then at Abbeville) had an interview with
Worcester on the subject. The trouble is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to have originated in the fact that Mistress
Popincourt had behaved herself with considerable
impropriety,&mdash;at least that was the accusation
the English envoy laid before his majesty of
France; but if we read between the lines of the
letters and documents connected with this side-plot,
we learn that it was Mistress Popincourt
who had first attempted to negotiate the marriage
of her mistress with King Louis by means of the
Duc de Longueville, whilst that nobleman was
still imprisoned in the Tower of London. As the
negotiations had succeeded, even through another
medium, she considered herself entitled to some
recompense for her share in the affair, and
probably attempted to blackmail the king; at any
rate, for one reason or another, he was so furious
with her, that on the occasion in question, he
told Worcester never to “name her any more
unto me.” “I would she were burnt,” he added;
“if King Henry make her to be burnt, he shall
do but well and a good deed!” Mary, however,
held the recalcitrant Popincourt in the highest
esteem. None the less, King Louis decided that
she should be there and then sent back to England,
but whether with a goodly recompense to
soothe her disappointment is not recorded.
Maybe she, who had done so much to further
the royal match, found herself better off than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the other unfortunate attendants on Princess
Mary, who, being dismissed after her arrival at
Abbeville, were stranded, penniless. Some of
these misguided ladies had, says Hall, “been
at much expense to wait on her [Princess Mary]
to France, and now returned destitute, which
many took to heart, insomuch some died by the
way returning, and some fell mad.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Evidently King Louis was determined not to
have too many Englishwomen in attendance upon
his wife, or, as he put it, “to spy upon his actions,”
for fresh difficulties arose, even after the Popincourt
incident was closed, and he and the princess
had been united in matrimony. According to
arrangement, certain of the queen’s ladies were
to return to England forthwith, but King Louis
and his English monitor, the Duke of Norfolk,
settled the matter by ordering that <i>all</i> Mary’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
train of young English gentlewomen and maidens,
with the exception of the Lady Anne Boleyn<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and
of three others, were to return home. This was
bad enough, but Mary was still more distressed to
find that her confidential attendant and nurse,
Mother Guildford, was very unceremoniously
packed off with the rest. “Moder” or “Mowder”
Guildford, as the queen was pleased to call her,
was the wife of Sir William Guildford, controller
of the royal household, who eventually stood
godfather to that unfortunate Guildford Dudley
who became the husband of Lady Jane Grey.
If we may believe King Louis, he had certainly
some justification for wishing Lady Guildford
out of his sight, since she exasperated him to such
an extent that he told Worcester that “rather
than have such a woman about my wife, I would
liever be without a wife.... Also, “he continued,
“I am a sickly body, and not at all times
that I would be merry with my wife like I to have
any strange woman with her, but one that I
am well acquainted with, afore whom I durst be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
merry.” The king went on to pathetically relate
the story of his own and his wife’s sufferings under
Lady Guildford’s iron rule. “For as soon as
she came on land,” says he, “and also when I
was married, Lady Guildford began to take upon
her not only to rule the queen, but also that she
should not come to me, but she should remain
with her, nor that no lady or lord should speak
with the queen but she [Lady Guildford] hear
it. Withal she began to set a murmur and
banding among the ladies of the French court.”
The “Moder” Guildford episode induced Mary
to write several letters home, one to Henry VIII
and another to Wolsey, complaining of the treatment
she had received with respect to the dismissal
of her attendants. In these she speaks
in no measured terms of the Duke of Norfolk,
who, as we have seen, had the matter in hand:
“I would to God,” she exclaims in the letter to
Henry VIII, “that my Lord of York [Wolsey]
had come with me instead of Norfolk, for then I
am sure I should not have been left as I am now!”
In fact, she cast the whole blame of the incident
on the shoulders of the Duke of Norfolk, whom
she ever afterwards disliked for his share in it.
Nevertheless, “Mowder” Guildford was sent back
to England, to the great distress and grief of her
royal mistress, who was preparing to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
violent scene on the subject with her rickety
husband, when the latter came into her chamber,
accompanied by two attendants bearing a tray
so heaped with rubies, diamonds and pearls, that
the cloud of anger instantly passed from the
queen’s brow, and her sunny smiles beamed
afresh, when she heard the politic and courteous
monarch say, “I have deprived you of one
treasure, let me now present you with another.”
And then he placed a collar of immense pearls
round her neck, and taking a heap of jewels in
his big hands, dropped them into her lap. “I
will have no Guildfords, Popincourts, or other
jades to mar my cheer or to stand betwixt me
and my wife,” he continued laughingly; “but
I intend to be paid for my jewels, and each kiss
my wife gives me shall cost me a gem.” On this
the covetous Mary kissed him several times, to
the number of eight, which he counted, and punctually
repaid by giving her eight enamelled buttons
surrounded by large pearls. By this amorous
playfulness, the astute Louis succeeded in making
his queen so contented with her lot, that she
presently told Worcester that “finding she was
now able to do as she liked in all things,” she
thought she was better without Lady Guildford,
and would decline to have her back again in France.
Mary not only forgave King Louis his share in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
business, but personally nursed him through an
attack of gout, which beset him at Abbeville,
and delayed the royal departure from that town
until October 31, when the quaint cavalcade
resumed its journey towards St. Denis.</p>

<p>It was one continuous pageant in every village
and town through which the royal <i>cortège</i> passed,
between Abbeville and St. Denis. Even in villages
and hamlets, children dressed as angels, with
golden wings, met the fair queen, to present to
her pretty gifts of fruit and flowers. It took
the king and queen and their escort six days to
reach St. Denis, spending the nights either in episcopal
palaces or in the splendid abbeys which
lined the way. Although the French greeted
the queen heartily, it was noticed that they
“became overcast and sour” as they looked on
the magnificent but defiant figure of the Duke
of Suffolk, as he rode, in his silver armour, on
the right side of the queen’s litter, whilst on the
left cantered that stalwart nobleman, Thomas
Grey, first Marquis of Dorset, who was destined
by a curious and unexpected event to become the
grandfather of Her Majesty’s ill-fated grandchildren,
the Ladies Jane, Katherine and Mary
Grey. At last, early in the morning of Sunday,
November 5, the English princess passed up the
splendid nave of St. Denis, escorted by all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was highest and mightiest in French chivalry.
The Duc de Longueville, the Duc d’Alençon,
the Duke of Albany, Regent of Scotland, the
Duke of Bourbon, and the Count de Vendôme,
preceded her, bearing between them the regalia.
Mary followed, escorted by the Duke of Valois,
and clothed in a mantle of cloth of gold. She
wore such a prodigious quantity of jewels that a
number of them had to be removed in the sacristy
before she was able to proceed with the innumerable
ceremonies of the day. The new queen was
anointed by the Cardinal de Pré, who also presented
her with the sceptre and “verge of justice.”
When, after more ceremony than prayer, the
cardinal had placed the crown of France upon
her brow, Prince Francis of Valois led Her
Majesty to a throne raised high above the choir,
whence in solitary state she glanced down upon
the throng of prelates, priests and noblemen
and noblewomen who crowded the chancel and the
altar-steps, and overflowed into the nave and
transepts. There she sat alone, for weak and
sickly King Louis could do no more than witness
the coronation, contenting himself by obtaining
a view of it from a small closet window above the
high altar.</p>

<p>The following day, at noon, Queen Mary passed
on to Paris, whither King Louis had preceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
her earlier in the morning. On this occasion
she did not occupy a litter, but rode by herself
in a species of carriage designated “a chaise or
chair,” embellished with cloth of gold, and drawn
by two milk-white horses with silver reins and
harness. Her Majesty, all in white and gold,
did not wear the crown of France, but merely
a diadem of pearls, from beneath which streamed
her luxuriant tresses. Pressing round the queen’s
chariot, rode the pick of the nobility of France,
followed by the Scotch Guard and a detachment
of German mercenaries. Pageants and allegories
greeted the royal progress at every turn. When
close to Paris, the queen’s train was met by
three thousand Parisian students, law officers
and representatives of the city council, who
chanted in chorus a quaint song, still extant, in
which Mary is likened to the Queen of Sheba
and Louis XII to King Solomon. Over the
portcullis of the Porte St. Denis was erected
a ship, containing “mountebanks” representing
Henry VIII in the character of Honour, and
Princess Mary as Ceres, whilst an actor, wearing
King Louis’s own gorgeous robes, offered “Ceres”
a bunch of grapes, and was popularly held to
personate Bacchus!</p>

<p>In the midst of what we should now consider
a circus-like cavalcade, the queen, escorted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a thousand horsemen bearing flaring torches,
passed round the quays of Paris, brilliantly
illuminated for the occasion, to her resting-place
at the Conciergerie, where, we are informed, she
was so dead tired that, after the official reception
by King Louis and subsequent banquet, she fell
asleep and had to be carried to her nuptial chamber.
Here, so it is stated, King Louis did not receive
her, since he was fast asleep already in his own
bedchamber at the Louvre, whither he had retired
many hours earlier. He was awake pretty early
the next day, for at nine o’clock he breakfasted
with the queen, having previously presented her
with a bouquet of gems, the flowers being made
of coloured stones and the leaves of emeralds.
The king never left his bride the whole of that
day, and it was observed that whenever he gazed
upon her, he would put his hand to his heart and
heave a deep sigh. Nothing can be imagined
more ludicrous, and at the same time more pathetic,
than the ardour of this poor, hopelessly love-sick
monarch for his beautiful wife, who, thorough
Tudor as she was, never missed an opportunity
of fleecing him of jewels and trinkets, to such an
extent as at last to excite the indignation of the
court.</p>

<p>The coronation festivities closed with jousts
in which “my lorde à Sofehoke,” as the Marquis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of Dorset calls him in a letter,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> got “a little hurt
in the hand.” In this same epistle the marquis
adds that King Louis considered that Suffolk and
his English company “dyd shame aule (all)
Franse.” They did such execution indeed that,
as the chroniclers complacently remark, “at
every course many dead were carried off without
notice taken.” The exasperation of the French
against Suffolk grew so great&mdash;or was it due, as
tradition suggests, to Francis of Valois’s personal
jealousy of the British duke?&mdash;that they commissioned,
contrary to all etiquette of tourney,
an abnormally powerful German trooper to kill
him by treachery in the lists. Suffolk, however,
saw through the mean trick, and refusing to
treat such a ruffian according to chivalric rules,
gripped him by the scruff of the neck, and
punched his head with much heartiness, to the
ill-concealed satisfaction of the spectators.</p>

<p>It does not require much imagination to divine
what were the thoughts of the lusty young queen,
as she watched the prowess of her triumphant
lover in the tilt-yard, and mentally contrasted
his manly beauty with the wreck that was her
husband, who lay on a couch at her side, “grunting
and groaning.” He, poor man, was ever
graciously courteous, and expressed his delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
whenever, in her enthusiasm, the lovely queen,
regardless of etiquette, rose to her feet and leant
over to applaud the British champions as they
rode by her canopy of state. “Ma mie,” cried
old Louis, “your eyes brighten like stars when
the English succeed. I shall be jealous.”
“Fie!” returned the queen with an arch smile,
“surely there is no chance for the French today,
since, fortunately for my countrymen, your
majesty is too unwell to join in the fray?”</p>

<p>When the queen rose to return to the palace,
the whole crowd burst into a storm of cheering,
crying: “Vive la Reine anglaise!” Mary’s
beauty was not the beauty of regularity of feature
so often found in France, but of that rarer sort,
peculiar to northerly regions, the beauty of
the glorious colouring of the blended Tudor and
Lancaster roses; so that when the queen
pressed forward to the gorgeously decorated balustrade
and kissed her hands to the people, the
enthusiasm of <i>ses bons Parisiens</i> passed all
bounds; and Mary Tudor’s tact and grace won all
hearts, when she insisted that the king should
lean upon her arm to descend the stairway.
Louise of Savoy, jealously noting all these things,
said to herself: “Elle ira loin, celle-là”; and
forthwith endeavoured to set her son, Francis of
Valois, against the young queen, whereby she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
only fanned his rising passion for her. If Queen
Mary Tudor had managed in a few hours to
captivate the Parisians, she failed to make a
favourable impression upon the court of France.
Her free and easy manner, her good nature, her
pleasant smiles, and, above all, her astounding
love of jewelry, were well calculated to stimulate
jealousy and hatred. The game against her now
began in earnest. Its object was to abstract the
king from her influence. But Mary was a Tudor,
and went ahead steadfastly, regardless of intrigues,
quips and frowns; and by a sheer display of good
nature and the firm obstinacy peculiar to her race,
succeeded in defeating her enemies, and having all
things her own way. Possibly, in her heart of
hearts, she rejoiced to think that she had an opportunity
of amassing great wealth by very easy
means, and was buoyed up by her secret passion
for the Duke of Suffolk, and the knowledge that,
with a little patience, she would be able to claim
him from her brother as a pledge of her good
behaviour whilst occupying the difficult position
of Queen of France.</p>

<p>Mary, notwithstanding her overwhelming passion
for Suffolk, was by far the most amiable
and respectable member of the Tudor family;
she behaved with the utmost propriety while
Queen of France, and her kindness to her infirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
husband filled him with a hopeless but chivalrous
passion, of which he gave practical expression by
a boundless generosity<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> that excited the jealousy
of the rest of the French royal family and imperilled
the safety of his greedy queen.</p>

<p>King Louis XII died on New Year’s Day 1515,
less than four months after his marriage, and his
widow immediately retired to the Hôtel de Cluny<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
to spend the first weeks of her widowhood in the
rigorous seclusion imposed by the etiquette of
the French court. She was obliged, according to
custom, to dress herself entirely in white, and to
remain the whole day long in a bed of state,
draped with black velvet. The room was darkened,
and only lighted with tapers of unbleached wax,
whilst all the queen’s meals were served on silver
platters covered with black silk cloths and
serviettes.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Louise of Savoy, mother
of the new king, Francis I, a most intriguing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
princess, began to agitate for the return of the
youthful dowager to England. She had made
up her mind that Mary should not wed the Archduke
Charles of Austria-Spain, who again came
forward as a suitor, nor yet encourage the attentions
of her own son, who had practically deserted
his consort, Claude, daughter of the late king by
his second wife, Anne of Brittany. The court
astrologers had persuaded Francis that before
many weeks were over, good Queen Claude, of
greengage fame,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> stout, short, and very plain,
would die, and that, as he was soon to become a
widower, he might just as well begin his courtship
at once. The duchess-mother, well versed
in the laxity of the age in which she lived, was
terribly afraid Francis might attempt to set aside
his wife, in order to marry the English widow,
in which event Claude’s rich heritage, the duchy
of Brittany, would pass from the French Crown.
She therefore resolved to get rid of Mary Tudor, a
resolution strengthened by her well-founded conviction
that even in the early days of her mourning,
Francis I had intruded into the widow’s presence.
At her first secret interview with the new king,
Mary told him plainly that her heart already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
belonged to Suffolk, and that she “was resolved to
marry none other.” She even reminded Francis
of his own neglected consort, and he, instead
of resenting this rebuff, promised to exert his
influence to obtain Henry VIII’s consent to
Mary’s union with her lover.</p>

<p class="pch">CLOTH OF FRIEZE WEDS CLOTH OF GOLD</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry</span> VIII was accused, at the time, of
having sent Suffolk as special ambassador, on
the death of King Louis, in order to lure his sister
back to England, with the object, as soon as he
had her in his power, of re-opening negotiations
for her marriage with the Archduke Charles of
Castile.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> If this was the case, he little understood
his sister’s character, for in her first interview with
Suffolk she gave him to understand that she
“would not land in her brother’s dominions
except as his [Suffolk’s] bride.” According to
the French contemporary historian Daniel,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> she
even declared: “If you do not court and wed me
within four days I will not hold you for much of
a man, and will stay abroad.” The duke, much
alarmed, remonstrated with her, objecting that
so exalted an alliance might lead to his ruin both
in France and England, seeing he was but “base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
born”; and, he might have added, already
married to no less than two wives, both still
living. The young dowager of France, however,
reminded him that “when she married King
Louis she had made it a condition that on becoming
a widow she was to have full liberty to marry
whom she chose, and she chose to marry none
other than himself.” Whereupon Suffolk, as he
subsequently informed his master, “could but
obey”; and, to use his homely expression, “she
and I were married.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Louise of Savoy’s spies soon informed her that
Mary and Suffolk were in constant communication
with each other, and she was even informed that
the duke had been seen leaving her apartment at
questionable hours. Seizing a favourable opportunity
when she knew the lovers to be together,
the duchess threw open the door of the queen’s
closet and, it seems, discovered Her Majesty and
her lover in so compromising a situation, that
“she ordered the startled couple into the chapel
and then and there had them married by a priest
who chanced to be saying Mass.” When Francis
heard the wedding was well over, he did all in his
power to propitiate his “dearly beloved brother
Henry VIII.” He was not very successful, however,
and Mary and her husband had to spend
some weeks of terrible suspense, during which an
astounding correspondence was kept up between
them, Henry VIII, and Wolsey,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> one of Mary’s
staunchest friends, who consistently took her
part. Most of Suffolk’s letters are undated, and
written in an almost illegible hand. Their tone
is honest enough, but he takes good care not
to allude to the fact that he had two wives
living. In one missive, of a particularly confidential
sort, he expresses fear that this royal
marriage may ruin him; and adds: “My Lord, as
the reverence of God, help that I may be married
as I go out of France openly for many things of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which I will advertise you.” The queen’s handwriting
in her numerous letters to her brother and
to the cardinal varies much, apparently according
to the state of her nerves. In some of them her
hand has evidently trembled, so as to render her
calligraphy almost illegible, and this is notably
the case in a document which settled her business
to her own satisfaction and most certainly to that
of her greedy brother. As we have seen, King
Louis had been very lavish with gifts of gold
and silver plate, and above all jewelry, including
even the celebrated “Star of Naples” (<i>Stella di
Napoli</i>),<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> a diamond of abnormal size and brilliance,
which Charles VIII had filched from Ferrante of
Naples, when he paid his unwelcome visit to Italy
in 1498. These glittering baubles, valued in those
days at the enormous sum of £200,000, equal
to over £1,000,000 of present currency, together
with her rich dower, Mary freely handed over to
Henry VIII, on condition that he recognized her
marriage with her worthless, though handsome,
husband and forgave them both. The deed of
gift<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> whereby the queen yields up all her treasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to Henry VIII, is preserved in the <i>Cottonían
Collection</i> in the King’s Library of the British
Museum. When Francis I learnt that she had
parted with the “Star of Naples” he waxed exceeding
wroth and attempted to repossess himself
of it. If Duchess Louise, who at this time ruled
her son, had not been in such a hurry to get rid
of the queen dowager, this affair of the Neapolitan
diamond might have cost Mary dear. Out of
France, however, it was necessary that she should
go, and the sooner the better; so she was allowed
to depart in peace, with all her valuables, which,
shortly after her arrival in England, were duly
handed over to the king, her brother.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry was so well pleased with the treasure
she brought him that he received his sister at
Greenwich Palace with effusion, and was ostentatiously
civil to Suffolk. On May 13, 1515, the Queen
Dowager of France and Charles Brandon were
re-married publicly in Grey Friars’ Church, Greenwich,
the ceremony being performed by the
Archbishop of Canterbury and graced by the presence
of King Henry and Katherine of Aragon.
The wedding was followed by a magnificent banquet,
the plan for the arrangement of the table
for which still exists. This plan proves that in
those days ladies and gentlemen were seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
alternately, according to their precedence, precisely
as at a modern dinner-party. In honour of
these unequal nuptials, elaborate jousts and
tournaments were held, in which the bridegroom,
and Thomas, Marquis of Dorset, Lady Jane’s
other grandfather, won great applause and many
prizes. A number of bridal portraits, intended
as gifts to friends, were painted on this occasion.
These depict Mary Tudor as a broad-faced woman,
with an evidently dazzling complexion, small
eyes, golden hair, and a firm but rather sensual
mouth. At the Historical Exhibition held in the
New Gallery in 1902, the writer was particularly
struck by the remarkable resemblance between
the disputed likeness of Jane Grey, preserved at
Althorp, and the small portrait of her grandmother,
Mary Tudor, attributed to Holbein, now in His
Majesty’s collection at Windsor Castle. Mary
has the same broad face with small features as
Jane Grey. Her expression is pleasing<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
bears a strong resemblance to the earlier likenesses
of Henry VIII. In the Windsor picture
the queen-duchess holds a globe in the shape of
an artichoke, above which, in the left corner
of the portrait, appear some lines, said to have
been composed by the Duke of Suffolk for the
occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq4n p1">“Cloth of gold, do not despise,<br />
Though thou hast wedded cloth of frieze.<br />
Cloth of frieze, be not too bold,<br />
Though thou hast wedded cloth of gold.”</p>

<p class="p1">The attitude assumed by Cardinal Wolsey in
the affair of Charles Brandon’s royal marriage
was friendly enough both to bride and bridegroom,
although in the course of the correspondence
which preceded the wedding, he reminded Suffolk,
in very straightforward fashion, of his “cloth-of-frieze”
origin. There was some mysterious connection
between the cardinal and Charles Brandon:
it seems, indeed, that Henry VIII had conceived
the sinister project of ridding himself of
his brother-in-law on some trumped-up charge
of treason, once he had possessed himself of her
treasure. Apparently Wolsey saved Brandon’s life
at that time, of which fact he reminded him some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
years later. Suffolk was one of the judges at Queen
Katherine’s trial (1529), and, being exasperated
one day by the way in which Wolsey constantly
impeded the king’s desire to close the matter at
once without appealing to Rome, he struck the
table, exclaiming loudly that “they had never
been merry in England since a cardinal came
amongst them.” Rising to his feet, Wolsey
replied with the utmost dignity: “Sir, of all men
within this realm, ye have the least cause to dispraise
or be offended with cardinals, for, but for
me, simple cardinal as I am, you at this moment
would have had no head upon your shoulders,
and therefore no tongue to make so rude a report
against me. You know what friendship ye have
received at my hand, and which never before this
time have I revealed to any one alive, either to my
own glory or to your dishonour.” Suffolk, who
well knew the circumstance to which the cardinal
alluded, rose abruptly,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and, abashed, left the
council chamber.</p>

<p>Wolsey evidently hinted at some matter connected
with Brandon’s weird matrimonial adventures
already related; or else to the fact that he
had saved him from the clutches of his brother-in-law
for some imprudence history has not revealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>After her return to England, Mary Tudor regained
her royal position, and for a brief time she lived
in considerable state at Suffolk’s house on his
Southwark estate. A year or two ago, a fair
Tudor archway and a few other remains of this
fine mansion were discovered during the erection
of some model school-houses. Suffolk Court,
as it was called, had two parks, one of which
stretched down to the bank of the Thames; and
in the extensive gardens there was a maze, or
labyrinth, similar to the one at Hampton Court.
A street in the neighbourhood is still known as
Suffolk Street, though probably not one of its
inhabitants is aware that it marks the site of a
princely residence. The Duke of Suffolk had yet
another dwelling in London, situated at the top
of the Strand: it was built in 1539 on a site occupied
in our day by Northumberland Avenue. He
and his royal consort frequently lived here, and
probably used it as their winter residence. They
occasionally rented Stepney Palace from the
bishops of London, and some of Mary’s letters
are dated thence.</p>

<p>At Suffolk Court, about eighteen months after
her marriage, Mary gave birth to a son, to whom
Henry VIII stood godfather, the christening
being attended by the king and queen. Some
time after his birth, the infant was taken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Bridewell Palace, where Henry raised him to
the rank of Earl of Lincoln. At Suffolk Court
the queen-duchess received and entertained the
Emperor Charles V, when he visited England to be
betrothed to the young Princess Mary. Notwithstanding
her <i>mésalliance</i>, the Duchess of Suffolk
was treated as the second lady in the realm,
precedence immediately after the queen being
accorded to her at all State functions, notably
during the great reception given to Charles V at
Canterbury (1518), and, later, at that unparalleled
pageant, the Field of the Cloth of Gold, at which
she figured both as dowager Queen of France and
as a princess of the blood royal and a duchess.</p>

<p>In March 1517 Mary and her husband accompanied
Katherine of Aragon on a pilgrimage to
Walsingham Priory. Three months later, the
duchess returned to London to entertain her
sister, Margaret of Scotland, whom she had not
seen since childhood; on this occasion Suffolk won
splendid success in a tournament before the king
and the then queen. Later in the same month,
Brandon and his wife were at Bishops Hatfield,
where, on July 16, was born the Lady Frances,
“who was mother to the Lady Jane Grey.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
queen-duchess, it appears, was suddenly taken ill
on her way from London to Suffolk, and had perforce
to ask the hospitality of the Bishop of Ely,
to whom Hatfield Palace in those days belonged.
Some years later it was confiscated by Henry VIII
and converted into a royal residence.</p>

<p>A very elaborate account of the manner in
which the parish church at Hatfield was decorated
“with cloth of gold and garlands of evergreen,”
on the occasion of the baptism of the said Lady
Frances, is still extant. The sponsors were Queen
Katherine and the young Princess Mary, who
were represented by proxy, the queen by the Lady
Anne Boleyn<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and the princess by the Lady
Elizabeth Grey. The Abbot of St. Albans was
godfather, and there was an abundant distribution
of viands, cakes, and wine, to the parishioners,
rich and poor alike.</p>

<p>In 1524 the queen-duchess gave birth to her
second daughter, the Lady Eleanor, who in due
time became Countess of Cumberland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>All this long while, Brandon’s discarded wife,
the Lady Mortimer, nursed her grievance (which
she held to be supported by an ecclesiastical
dispensation in her possession) against the Duke
of Suffolk, so that, justly incensed as she was at
his marriage with the ex-queen of France, she
endeavoured to force him to recognize her as his
legitimate wife; which he steadfastly refused to
do. Possibly, in a sense, she blackmailed him,
knowing full well the parlous position in which
he had placed himself. Some time in 1524,
therefore, just before the birth of the Lady Eleanor,
Lady Mortimer must have clamoured so loudly
for the return of her recalcitrant husband to his
conjugal duties, as to make herself very unpleasant,
for Brandon was once more fain to have recourse
to the law to obtain an official absolute dissolution
of his connection with her. He appealed to the
ecclesiastical and to the civil courts, and received
a favourable verdict from both, the marriage between
himself and the Lady Mortimer being declared
null and void. This decision, however, did
not satisfy Wolsey as a sufficient protection for the
queen and her children against the humiliating
aspersions persistently cast on them by Lady
Mortimer and her friends. In 1528 a mission,
headed by Stephen Gardiner and Edward Fox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was sent to Orvieto, where Clement VII was then
residing,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> with the object of inducing His Holiness
to despatch Cardinal Campeggio to England to
represent the pope on the Commission for the
matter of the divorce of Queen Katherine of
Aragon. Wolsey availed himself of this mission
to forward an account, written by Suffolk and
endorsed by himself, of the reasons why the
duke petitioned the Pontiff for the dissolution
of his marriage with the Lady Mortimer. In
this document Suffolk declared that, “although
a lapse of time had passed, instead of diminishing,
it only increased his crime, and hence his seeking
this divorce from a woman with whom he was too
closely allied.” Clement, after due investigation,
and on the strength of Wolsey’s assurance, issued
a bull dissolving the marriage with Lady Mortimer,
and declaring the children of Anne Browne, alias
Brandon, the second wife, legitimate. This bull,
dated Orvieto, May 12, 1528, was not, however,
published in England until August of the following
year, when Bishop Nix of Norwich read it from
the pulpit of his cathedral, to a no doubt highly
interested and gossiping congregation. This successful
appeal to Rome apparently settled the
matter, even in the eyes of Lady Mortimer herself,
for she presently took a third husband,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Robert
Horn, Esq., with whom she lived in peace for the
rest of her life, which, however, was not long,
for the invaluable <i>Baronagium</i> informs us that
she died before the marriage of Suffolk’s second
daughter, the Lady Eleanor Brandon, which took
place in 1537.</p>

<p>Anne and Mary, the two daughters of Brandon
by his second wife, Anne Browne, became respectively
Baroness Powis and Viscountess Monteagle.
After her mother’s death, the first-named
lady, in accordance with the custom of those days,
was sent abroad for her education and placed in
the household of Suffolk’s faithful friend, Margaret
of Savoy, Governess of the Netherlands. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the State Papers is a letter written by Suffolk, and
dated May 13, 1515, in which he thanks the duchess
for her kindness to his daughter Anne, and begs
she will allow her to return to England “at the
request of the queen dowager, my wife.” He
sent Sir E. Guildford and Mr. William Woodale to
escort the young lady home. Both Miss Strickland
and Miss Green, in their respective lives of Mary
Tudor, and Mr. Howard, in his <i>Life of Jane
Grey</i>, state that Lady Powis, in the thirteenth
year of Elizabeth, charged Frances, Duchess of
Suffolk, and her sister Eleanor, Countess of
Cumberland, with bastardy. This is an error,
since an entry in Machyn’s <i>Diary</i> proves that
Lady Powis died in 1557,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> during the reign of
Mary. That the <i>affaire Mortimer</i> was revived in
the thirteenth year of Elizabeth is true, for among
the State Papers we find documents relative to the
matter; but it was probably put forward at the
instigation of Elizabeth herself, merely as a test
case, to settle, once and for all, the validity of
the claims of the Ladies Katherine and Mary Grey
and their heirs to the succession. The verdict then
given confirmed the decision arrived at, forty-two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
years previously, and the document containing it
is endorsed in Burleigh’s own hand.</p>

<p>Lady Monteagle,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Brandon’s second daughter,
enjoyed the rare distinction of being limned by
Holbein, and her portrait is one of the most
magnificent in all the collection of drawings of
the nobility of the court of Henry VIII, now in
the possession of His Majesty the King. She is
represented as an exceedingly handsome woman,
and wears some fine pearl ornaments, one of them
being a medallion in the shape of the letter “M,”
composed of very large gems. There was some
doubt, at one time, as to whether this particular
portrait represented the first or second Lady
Monteagle, but the fashion of the gown and the
coif, in conjunction with the discovery of the exact
date of Holbein’s death, settles the question
beyond dispute, and in this drawing we have an
undoubted presentment of Brandon’s younger
daughter by his second wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to his wives, Brandon had a notorious
mistress, who bore him several children, one of
whom, Sir Charles Brandon, had a son who was
a celebrated jeweller in the reign of Elizabeth,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
and who, some say, was the father of that
Richard Brandon who is alleged to have beheaded
Charles I.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> These scandals and many others, of
which we know little or nothing, though some are
hinted at in the correspondence of the various
ambassadors, no doubt affected the happiness
of the queen-duchess, and account for the infrequency
of her visits to London and her rare
appearances at court functions.</p>

<p class="pch">THE LAST DAYS OF SUFFOLK AND OF THE QUEEN-DUCHESS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> Mary Tudor’s exalted rank,
her husband neglected her. The Chronicles and
State Papers of the period frequently allude to
this sad fact. The death of her only son, the
young Earl of Lincoln, of the “sweating sickness,”
which occurred in 1527, when he was only twelve
years old, affected her health, so that she retired
from London, and spent nearly all her time at
Westhorpe Hall, a grand Tudor mansion near Bury
St. Edmunds, which remained intact until the
beginning of the last century, when it was pulled
down to make room for the present ugly and
uninteresting structure. The ancient furniture,
some of which had evidently belonged to the
queen-duchess, was sold in 1805, and amongst the
other miscellaneous lots put up to auction was a
lock of Mary Tudor’s fair hair, which was purchased
by a Suffolk antiquary for seven shillings.</p>

<p>Mary espoused, as far as she dared, the cause of
her unhappy sister-in-law, Katherine of Aragon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and it is not surprising, therefore, that though
in London at the time, she did not attend the
coronation of Anne Boleyn, where her husband
figured so conspicuously as Lord High Constable
of England. He behaved abominably to Queen
Katherine, and even insulted her grossly when he
was sent by Henry to Bugden to visit her, just
before her removal to Kimbolton; so coarsely,
indeed, that the queen ordered him out of her
presence, reminding him, at the same time, of the
many favours she had heaped upon him when she
was in power.</p>

<p>The royal grandmother of the unfortunate
sisters of the House of Grey seems never to have
enjoyed good health. As far back as 1518, Suffolk
wrote to Wolsey to inform him that the queen-duchess,
his wife, was ill of a “anagu” [an ague],
the cure of which gave the king’s “fuesesune”
plenty of good occupation. The word “physician”
was apparently an orthographic stumbling-block
to both the duke and his consort. Early in
February 1533, Mary Tudor wrote from Westhorpe
Hall to the king, informing him that she intended
coming to London to consult “Master Peter, her
fesysyon”; as her health was failing, she felt it
wise to seek other advice. Accordingly, towards
the middle of April, she arrived, with her two
daughters, at Suffolk Court; here preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
were at once made for the marriage of the elder
of these young ladies with the youthful Marquis
of Dorset, and for the betrothal of the younger,
the Lady Eleanor, to Lord Henry Clifford, eldest
son of the Earl of Cumberland. These combined
ceremonies were solemnized in the first week of
May, most likely in that stately parish church
which is now Southwark Cathedral. Henry VIII
attended the function, but whether he was accompanied
by Anne Boleyn, who was already queen,
though not as yet crowned, we know not.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>A few days later, on May 19, Queen Anne
Boleyn passed in triumph through the streets of
London from the Tower to Westminster Abbey,
to be crowned. On either side of her open litter,
sumptuously hung with silver tissue, and borne
by two milk-white palfreys draped in white
brocade, rode the Duke of Suffolk and Henry,
Marquis of Dorset, who bore the sceptre. Cecily,
dowager Marchioness of Dorset, was with the old
Duchess of Norfolk in a chariot that followed
the litter conveying the queen, who in glittering
robes of cloth of gold and with a circlet of magnificent
rubies crowning her raven tresses, “freely
exposed the beauty of her person to the gaze of
the people.” But the populace, even as it gazed
upon her loveliness, did not forget the good “old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
queen” it had worshipped, who was even then
lying sick unto death at Bugden Hall in Huntingdonshire.
Anne was received in dead silence,
throughout the whole line of the procession: not
a cap was raised in her honour.</p>

<p>On June 26, of this same year (1533), the
queen-duchess&mdash;who had returned with Lady
Dorset, the bride, and her younger daughter, the
Lady Eleanor, to Westhorpe, none the better for
consulting the Court “fesysyon”&mdash;died somewhat
suddenly, in the presence of her two children; her
husband and son-in-law being still in London.
Her body was embalmed and carried to Bury
Abbey on July 20, nearly a month after her
decease. Garter King at Arms and other heralds
preceded the hearse, which was followed by a
procession of lords and ladies on horseback, among
whom, as chief mourners, the Ladies Frances and
Eleanor rode pillion on the same black steed,
caparisoned with violet cloth. They were supported
on either side by the Marquis of Dorset
and the young Lord Clifford, who had been
summoned from London to attend the funeral.
A strange incident occurred during the ceremony,
at which the Duke of Suffolk was not present.
The Ladies Powis and Monteagle, the duke’s
daughters by his second wife, appeared uninvited,
and assisted at the Mass, on perceiving which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
intrusion, the Lady Frances and the Lady Eleanor
rose, and left the church, without waiting for
the conclusion of the office. The unbidden guests
had evidently determined to assert their position
in the family by appearing at their step-mother’s
obsequies, an act which was openly resented by
the rest of the family,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> since it was intended to
prove the Ladies Powis and Monteagle’s legitimacy,
and, moreover, insinuate that the queen-duchess’s
daughters were bastards.</p>

<p>Mary Tudor’s death<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> may well have been
hastened by anxiety about the calamities that had
overwhelmed her sister-in-law, Queen Katherine,
and by the certainty that her own husband had
been Henry’s most active confederate in maligning
the luckless queen. Suffolk’s behaviour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Katherine of Aragon was, in fact, infamous and
ungrateful in the extreme. In the early stages of
his career she had given him a helping hand, she
had accepted entertainment at his house, and had
stood godmother to his elder daughter; yet, in the
hour of misfortune, he turned against her, and
became her “unjust judge” and bitterest foe. He
treated Anne Boleyn in the same fashion. When
that ill-fated woman’s star reached its zenith,
the craven duke was one of her most obsequious
courtiers, but no sooner did the shadow of her
impending doom darken the horizon, than Suffolk
deserted her, went over to her enemies, urged his
master to hasten her destruction, and outraged
decency&mdash;even the decency of those callous times&mdash;by
appearing at her execution. He was also
present as one of the Privy Council when, some
hours before her death, she was compelled to hear
the sentence: That her marriage with the king
was “invalid, frustrate, and of none effect.” So,
too, when poor Anne of Cleves displeased the king
by her Dutch homeliness, Suffolk was overheard
offering his advice as to the best means of getting
rid of her. Katherine Howard fared no better at
his hands. He was her flatterer in her brief hour
of success, but it was he who escorted her as a
prisoner from Sion House to the Tower, who judged
her, and who, but for sudden indisposition, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
have feasted his eyes on her mangled form when
her head was struck off at one blow by the skilful
Calais headsman who had already proved his
dexterity at the execution of Anne Boleyn.</p>

<p>In November 1534 the duke took a fourth
wife, his deceased consort’s ward, the Lady
Katherine Willoughby d’Eresby, a child of fifteen,
whose rich dower had evidently excited his
rapacity; for, notwithstanding his vast landed
possessions, he was in constant want of ready
money, Mary Tudor’s income having been very
scanty, and most irregularly paid. Katherine was
the only child of the lately deceased William,
Lord Willoughby d’Eresby by his second wife,
Doña Maria de Sarmiento y Salinas, a Spanish
noblewoman and a faithful and tried attendant
upon Queen Katherine. It seems incredible that
such a pious woman should have approved of so
unnatural an alliance, but in Tudor times the voice
of Nature herself was often hushed, and that
of personal and political interest alone heard.
Katherine, Duchess of Suffolk, of whom we shall
see more anon, developed into a very handsome
and cultured woman, and was the authoress of quite
the most brilliant and witty letters in the English
epistolary literature of the period. She had the
distinction of being sketched by Holbein, and
her portrait is one of the most beautiful in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
king’s collection. By this lady, Suffolk had two
sons, who survived him and became successively
Dukes of Suffolk. They were reputed to be
exceedingly clever lads, and were educated with
Prince Edward. Both died at an early age, on
July 6th, 1551, of the “sweating sickness,” at
Bugden, in Huntingdonshire, within a few hours
of each other and in the same bed.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after his fourth marriage, Suffolk wrote
to his mother-in-law, the dowager Lady Willoughby,
that he had been ordered to proceed to Bugden
Hall to reduce the household of the “Princess
Dowager,” as the divorced queen was now called,
and to induce her to remove to Fotheringhay Castle.
He adds that he wishes “an accident might befall
him” to prevent his undertaking so unpleasant an
expedition. Notwithstanding this heroic desire,
Suffolk arrived at Bugden Hall late in December<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
1534/5, and behaved so abominably that the poor
queen, stung to the quick by the repeated humiliations
and insults heaped upon her and her handful
of faithful retainers, rose and swept haughtily
from his presence. She resolutely refused to go to
Fotheringhay, which, she had heard, was “damp,”
but after much more trouble she submitted to
being sent to Kimbolton, where she arrived early
in the following January.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>On January 7, 1535/6, the sorely tried and
persecuted queen passed quietly away at Kimbolton
Castle, in the arms of Lady Willoughby,
and in the presence of Eustache Chapuys, the
imperial ambassador; being “done to death by
cruelty,” as her Spanish chronicler quaintly and
faithfully puts it.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The public career of Jane Grey’s maternal
grandfather was far more creditable than his
private life. In early manhood, as we have seen,
he distinguished himself as a naval commander,
and he later became a skilful general, affording
his master most efficient help against the popular
rising known as the “Pilgrimage of Grace.”
During that otherwise futile expedition into
Picardy which resulted in King Henry’s only substantial
French victory, the capture of Boulogne,
Suffolk proved himself both bold and sagacious,
and was able to present the keys of that city to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
king. He was also of great service all through
the intricate operations against the Scots, which
occupied English diplomacy and arms from 1543
to 1544, and formed the first link in the chain of
misfortunes marking the untoward career of Mary
Stuart&mdash;since these certainly arose out of the
attempt made by Henry VIII to affiance his son
Edward to the infant Queen of Scots, and so secure
the custody of her person. This effort, had it
been crowned with success, would have united the
Crowns of England and Scotland some fifty years
before the union of the two kingdoms was finally
accomplished, under James I.</p>

<p>In 1532-33, when Henry VIII and Francis I
held a conference in the Church of Our Lady at
Boulogne, such was the piety of bluff King Hal
that he was well pleased to attend as many as
three and four Masses every day before St. Mary’s
shrine, whilst round him knelt the Dukes of
Suffolk and Norfolk; the Marquises of Dorset and
Exeter; the Lords of Surrey, Essex, Derby,
Rutland, Huntingdon and Sussex; and a legion
of other noblemen and knights. Boulogne was
greatly edified at beholding the French and
English Kings, the King of Navarre, the Dauphin,
and the Princes of Orleans, Angoulême, Vendôme,
and Guise, together with a glittering train of
French and English peers, devoutly telling their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
rosaries, and following the cherished image in
solemn procession through the streets. But in
July 1544 all this was changed. Suffolk ordered
the Church of Notre Dame to be desecrated and
occupied by the English artillery. The sacred
image, however, was carefully packed and sent
over to England, where Henry, who had burnt
the Lady of Walsingham and “her old syster of
Ipswich,” preserved it in high veneration in his
own bedroom. Edward VI, at the time of the
restitution of Boulogne, consented to restore the
treasure, and Louis de la Tremeuil, Prince of
Talmont, was deputed to fetch it back to its time-honoured
shrine.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In August 1545 Suffolk died, after a long illness,
at Guildford Castle, which had evidently been
lent to him by Sir William Parr, who had it from
the king. The duke’s illness seems to have been,
in every phase, identical with that of the king, who
died of a similar complication of diseases not two
years later: Charles suffered from gout, heart
failure, rheumatism, and dropsy. Henry VIII
expressed great interest and anxiety concerning
him, and sent constantly to Guildford to obtain
news of his old friend and life-long companion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
One of Suffolk’s portraits, painted in the last year
of his life, represents him looking much older than
he really was, and extremely like Henry VIII.
He wears a dressing-gown and a silk skull cap, and
his feet, much swollen with gout, are resting on
a stool. During his last illness, the duke was
attended by his wife and his two daughters, the
Ladies Frances and Eleanor. He expired in their
presence and in that of his grand-children, including
Katherine Grey. Suffolk left instructions
in his will that he was to be buried in an obscure
Lincolnshire parish, without pomp, but Henry VIII
ordered otherwise, and gave his accommodating
brother-in-law and friend splendid obsequies at
Windsor, where his tomb may still be seen, on
the right-hand entrance to St. George’s Chapel.
Requiem Masses for the repose of the soul of
“the most High and Puissant Prince,” Charles,
Duke of Suffolk, were said at St. Paul’s and at
Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Suffolk left all his property to his widow and
her children, with reversion to his daughters
Frances and Eleanor Brandon, respectively Marchioness
of Dorset and Countess of Cumberland,
and to their heirs and successors, who are named.
His widow retired to her lodging at the Barbican,
where she was several times visited by the Lady
Frances and her daughters, and by the Princesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Mary and Elizabeth, the latter being her sincere
friend, whereas the former disliked her exceedingly,
on account of her change of religion. When the
duchess, some short time after the death of her
first husband, took unto herself a second, in the
person of her young secretary, Mr. Bertie, an
aggressive Protestant, Queen Mary was exceedingly
wroth at what she considered to be a <i>mésalliance</i>.
Mr. Bertie and the Duchess fled from England,
and after staying awhile in Germany and visiting
Venice, succeeded, despite many romantic adventures,
in reaching Poland. The duchess and her
“unequal match” did not return to England
until after Mary’s death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a><br /><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c83" id="c83">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="pch">BIRTH AND CHILDHOOD</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lady Katherine Grey</span>, two years younger
than her unfortunate sister, the Lady Jane, was
born in August 1540, and, according to tradition,
not at Bradgate Hall in Leicestershire, but in
London, at Dorset Place, Westminster, a mansion
which the Duke of Suffolk, her father, then Marquis
of Dorset, had purchased and rebuilt in
the finest Tudor architecture of the period, having
a very long gallery and terrace, overlooking the
Thames. It was considerably altered towards
the close of the sixteenth century, when it was
divided into three separate houses, and in one of
these Locke the philosopher lived and died. A
relic of the existence of this palace was extant
only a few years ago, in the name of a little street
called Dorset Place, which was pulled down for
modern improvements when the new War Office
and its adjacent edifices were built.</p>

<p>There is, needless to say, no registered record
of Lady Katherine’s birth, and we know very
little of how her childhood was spent. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
hygienic and more humane methods of rearing
children, which are now in vogue, were then unknown.
Lady Katherine’s little limbs must have
been swathed in swaddling clothes, precisely as
were those of all her infant contemporaries. She
was certainly not nursed by her mother&mdash;which
would have been against all precedent in royal
circles of society&mdash;but by some country foster-mother,
possibly the Mrs. Helen who performed
the same office for Lady Jane, and who attended
that unfortunate princess on the scaffold. A
foster-mother in the family of the great position
of the Dorsets was in many ways a personage.
Her costume was rich; her board and lodging
expensive, even luxurious; and the children she
nursed were taught to consider her almost in
the light of a mother, and this, many years after
the very necessary functions which she had performed
for their benefit had ceased.</p>

<p>The child’s costume as she grew up was cut on
absolutely the same pattern as that of her mother,
of which it was a miniature reproduction, without,
however, the train or <i>manteau de cour</i>, which the
Lady Frances only wore on state occasions. At
five years of age, Lady Katherine wore long petticoats
and a dress of brocade reaching to the feet,
a ruff, and a little white cap, tied in a bow under
the chin. There is still in existence a list or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
inventory of the toys which were in the possession
of Princess Elizabeth when she was an infant at
Hunsdon. They included a number of dolls of
all sizes, one or two mechanical, “that could
speke” and even walk (evidently imported from
Italy), a wooden horse on rockers, a set of marionettes,
some little cooking utensils, and no doubt
most popular of all, a kind of Noah’s Ark, containing
“beesties and Noah with hys familie.”
With similar toys, doubtless, the little Lady
Katherine and her sister Jane frequently did play.</p>

<p>As she grew older she was placed, to learn her
letters, under the care of a certain Mrs. Ashley or
Astley (sister or sister-in-law of the lady who figures
so largely in history as the governess of Queen Elizabeth),
who remained in the quality of governess-companion
to the children of the Marquis of
Dorset until the death of Lady Jane, when we
lose sight of her, unless indeed the little Lady
Mary was placed in her charge and remained at
Bradgate during the tragic events that decimated
her family.</p>

<p>Lady Katherine’s entry into what we should
now call society, took place on the 20th August,
1547, when that renowned, not to say redoubted,
lady, Bess of Hardwick, married her second
husband, Sir William Cavendish. For some reason
or other which has escaped record, this wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
took place at Bradgate Hall, in Leicestershire,
evidently placed at the disposal of the bride and
bridegroom by the Dorsets. The nuptial knot
was tied at two o’clock in the morning, according
to a curious custom of nocturnal marriages which
holds good to this day in certain parts of America,
Italy, and Spain. There was a house-party
assembled for this festive occasion, and among the
guests were the Earl of Shrewsbury, who in due
time became the fourth husband of the bride of
that day&mdash;or better, night&mdash;and the Marchioness
of Northampton, the discarded wife of Katherine
Parr’s brother, a lady who had had a very curious
and adventurous history, which excluded her from
court, although, at the time of her death, she was
staying at Sudeley Castle, as the guest of
Henry VIII’s sixth wife, Katherine Parr. The
Marchioness was evidently a very great friend of
the Dorset family, with whom, for all her rather
scandalous reputation, she was a frequent visitor.
The wedding must have taken place in the private
chapel (which is still standing) of the now ruined
hall, and amongst those present were the Marquis
and Marchioness of Dorset, with their three
daughters, the Ladies Jane, Katherine and Mary,
who acted as bridesmaids. Immediately after
the wedding ceremony, a sort of breakfast was
served, after which, with much music and noise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the bride and bridegroom were led in procession
to the bridal chamber. This marriage taking
place at Bradgate, shows how early was the connection
that existed between Bess of Hardwick and
the Greys&mdash;a connection which, some twenty
years later, proved a very uncomfortable one for
the said Bess, since it sent her to the Tower.</p>

<p>As Bess of Hardwick will be mentioned again in
these pages, it may be well to remind the reader
here, that she was the daughter of a certain
Mr. John Hardwick, a small Derbyshire yeoman
farmer or squire, and one of seven or eight brothers
and sisters. She had acquired, under her paternal
roof, an excellent knowledge of brewing, baking,
starching, making of elder and cowslip wine,
preserves and cordials; but she grew tired of the
country, early in life, and on one occasion, without
warning any of her relatives, put herself in communication
with Lady Zouch,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> a distant cousin,
who was then residing in London, in a prominent
position at the court of Henry VIII. To Lady
Zouch, therefore, Bess addressed herself, begging
of her not to think it impertinent that she should
write to her, but to remember her forlorn condition
and take compassion on it. It would seem that
Derbyshire, and especially that part of it in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
she lived, was not conducive to matrimony, and
the enterprising Bess thought that if she could
come to London as companion to Lady Zouch,
she might succeed in extricating herself from the
narrow circumstances in which she had hitherto
lived. Lady Zouch replied favourably, and invited
Mistress Elizabeth Hardwick to come and
stay with her. She had not been very long under
her noble cousin’s roof, ere she formed the acquaintance
of old Mr. John Barlow. He was
seventy, and Bess was considerably under twenty.
The gentleman, who was a great invalid, was very
rich; the young lady was active and healthy, but
poor. She became his nurse, and rubbed his legs and
applied his leeches and poultices with such admirable
skill, avoiding giving him unnecessary pain,
that he proposed to her and was accepted. Mr.
Barlow did not long survive his wedding, and when
he died, Bess inherited every penny of his fortune.
Having now secured wealth, she was determined
to acquire rank. Her next choice fell upon Sir
William Cavendish, a son of that Thomas Cavendish
who assisted Henry VIII in suppressing
the monasteries, and who wrote an excellent life
of Cardinal Wolsey. Sir William was not a very
young man when he first made the acquaintance
of Mistress Barlow, and he was already the father
of six sons and daughters. Bess, who wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
be a “lady,” forgave him this numerous progeny,
even going so far as to declare she would be a
mother unto them all. It is at this period of her
existence that she begins to loom largely in the
social history of her time. During the ten years
that she was Cavendish’s wife, she filled his quiver
with not less than eight children, four sons and
four daughters, one of whom, Elizabeth, had by
way of godmother Queen Elizabeth, the Lady
Katherine Grey representing “Our Eliza” by
proxy. This Elizabeth Cavendish in due time
married Darnley’s youngest brother (there were
seventeen years between them), and became,
eventually, the mother of the unfortunate Arabella
Stuart, whose life-story runs on almost
parallel lines with that of Lady Katherine Grey,
her godmother by proxy. Both were the victims
of their unfortunate love affairs and of the vindictiveness
of Elizabeth, who was determined to
have as few heirs to her Throne as possible. Bess,
after the death of Sir William, married again, for
the third time, Mr. William Saintlow or St. Lo,
a rich gentleman, captain in Queen Elizabeth’s
bodyguard, and considered to be the handsomest
man in Europe.</p>

<p>In the case of the Cavendish children, Bess
behaved admirably, but she evidently took a
fierce dislike to the Saintlow progeny, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
she treated so abominably that they never set
foot inside their father’s house until his death,
when they attended his funeral, to learn that he
had left them all his available property. The
ambitious Mrs. Saintlow, wishing to still further
increase her rank, next married George Talbot,
Earl of Shrewsbury. This marriage was not a
very happy one, mainly through the strange
circumstances in which the earl and countess
were placed. They were obliged by Queen Elizabeth
to take into their charge the unfortunate
Mary Queen of Scots; and Bess, by marrying
her daughter, Elizabeth, to young Charles Lennox,
Darnley’s brother, became the grandmother of
Arabella Stuart, which, to use her own words,
was “the greatest trouble that ever God inflicted
upon her.” Bess of Hardwick built Hardwick
Hall, near Chatsworth, one of the most beautiful
Elizabethan mansions in England, and possibly
the only one which still contains intact the furniture,
tapestries and works of art which its builder
installed there.</p>

<p>After the wedding of Mrs. Barlow with Sir
William Cavendish, the name of Lady Katherine
Grey becomes more conspicuous in the memorials
of her family. We know, for instance, that,
together with her parents and her sisters, Jane and
Mary, she spent the Christmas of 1551 with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
cousin, Princess Mary, afterwards queen, at
Hunsdon. The princess had provided a good
deal of amusement for the children, in the shape
of singers and conjurers obtained from London.
In the following year (1552/3), the Marquis of
Dorset&mdash;now become Duke of Suffolk, thanks to
the Lord Protector Somerset, and consequently to
Edward VI&mdash;helped Katherine, Duchess of Suffolk,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
to entertain a large party at Tilsey, the seat
of the young Willoughbys, who were her grace’s
wards. There still exists, in the archives of the
Willoughby family, a note-book of household
expenses drawn up by “old Mr. Medley,” a
connection of the family who acted as a sort of
majordomo. Mr. Medley informs us that for
the forty guests and servants who were being
entertained, as much as £200 a week was spent
for meat, fowls, fish, fruit, sweetmeats, etc. He
likewise says that a sum of six pounds, equivalent to
about sixty of our money, was given to the manager
of Lord Oxford’s players, who brought his troupe
to Tilsey, with the permission of the earl, to perform
before the company on three separate days,
when they gave, no doubt to the huge delight of
the children, some of those horse-play comedies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and farces which amused our Tudor ancestors,
and which included amongst their attractions
such items as “four hobby-horses, two dragons,
four men as monkeys, a giraffe, and a man that
swallowed fire.” Such wonders as these, probably,
greatly pleased Lady Katherine and her little
sisters, for children are the same in all ages. Then
there were “romps, games and dances” in the
great hall; and altogether, to use our familiar
expression, the young people had “a real good
time” at Tilsey&mdash;which doubtless contrasted
rather unpleasantly with the formal hospitality
offered them a fortnight later by the duke’s
sister, the Lady Audley, at Saffron Walden, where
there was a preacher engaged to improve their
manners and their morals. Bullinger, who got
wind of the very secular form of entertainment
ordered by the Duke of Suffolk for the amusement
of his young guests at Tilsey, took umbrage, and
wrote one or two bitter letters about it, which,
let us hope, never fell into the hands of his grace,
else the cause of the Reformation might have
suffered considerably thereby. Probably the duke
was not at this time as completely converted
to Puritanism as he was a couple of years later.
After their visit to Walden, the whole family rode
up to London, the little Ladies Katherine and
Jane perched on pillions in front of their father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and their uncle John. Here they were again
entertained by Princess Mary, at the Priory,
Clerkenwell. When the Suffolks returned to Bradgate,
they stayed in Leicester, and were entertained
with wine and hippocras and more solid
refreshments by the mayoress and her sister.
After partaking of these, they proceeded to
Bradgate, three miles farther on.</p>

<p>So many cross-country journeys on horseback,
to and fro, from Bradgate to Hunsdon, Hunsdon
to Tilsey, Tilsey to Saffron Walden, from Saffron
Walden to London, and then a three-days’ journey
back to Leicestershire, either in a litter or
on horseback, told unfortunately on the health
of the little Ladies Jane and Katherine, and both
of them&mdash;and no wonder!&mdash;were laid up for a
week or so with serious illnesses. Indeed, Lady
Katherine’s health, like that of her sister Jane,
seems, throughout her life, to have been very
fragile, for later we shall hear of her being frequently
ill with fever, headaches, and rheumatic
pains.</p>

<p>The Lady Frances and her husband, the Duke
of Suffolk,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> never seem to have destined Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Katherine, as they did her sister Jane, to play
any very conspicuous part in history. Jane they
set aside and educated, coached&mdash;or better,
“crammed”&mdash;to be the head of the Protestant
party in England, and, as such, either to share
the Throne with her cousin, Edward VI, or else to
occupy it alone, instead of the Catholic Princess
Mary, or of Elizabeth, whose religious opinions were
not at this time clearly defined. Lady Jane, very
skilfully surrounded by the most able and learned
Reformers of her time, was veritably moulded
for the dizzy but unfortunate station for which
she was destined, and her parents, in their eagerness
to fit her to occupy the Throne on the death
of the sickly Edward VI, did not even allow her
the time to take necessary recreation. The memorable
interview between Lady Jane and Roger
Ascham proves that the poor child was tortured
into learning. If by chance, worn out by study,
she turned to lighter things than Greek or Latin
grammar, she got so many “bobs and pinches”
from her charming mother, “that for pain she was
fain to weep”; or find relief from so much cruelty
and trouble in the unusual recreation, for a young
girl, of reading Plato’s <i>Dialogues</i> or the <i>Orations</i>
of Demosthenes. Ascham found Lady Katherine
otherwise engaged, enjoying herself with the rest
of the company at hunting and archery and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sports in which her mother, the Lady Frances,
excelled. It is not surprising, then, to find that
Bullinger, Œcolampadius, Conrad Pellican, Ulmer
and the many other Reformers who flocked to
England during the reign of Edward VI, and
who were specially welcome at Bradgate, had very
little or nothing to do with Lady Katherine.
Under the shade of the beautiful trees of Bradgate,
therefore, and in the sunlight of its broad and
flower-covered meadows; in the stately avenues
of its gardens and by the running brooks and
broad pools of its park, the girlhood of Lady
Katherine Grey was passed, we may presume,
far more pleasantly and naturally than that of
her sister Jane. She was at least allowed to
indulge in sports and pastimes suitable to her
age, to try her skill at archery and possibly
to leap a fence on a favourite pony, to dance
in the hall, and may be to sing a ballad to the
accompaniment of a lute, aye, even to practise
on the virginals, without incurring, as her elder
sister had done, the displeasure of good Master
Bullinger, who in one of his most remarkable
letters, written at the request of Aylmer,
cautioned the Lady Jane against the vanities
of this world and urged her to dress soberly,
as becomes a Christian maiden, by taking as her
model the Princess Elizabeth!&mdash;above all, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
lose time in practising music and in other like
frivolities.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>In his history of Lady Jane Grey (<i>The Nine-days’
Queen</i>), the author pointed out that the
legends as to any intimacy or love-making having
ever existed between Lady Jane and her cousin
King Edward VI, are absolutely apocryphal.
Although at one time the Lord Admiral Thomas
Seymour actually suggested that, in the event
of the engagement between Edward and the
Queen of Scots failing, the Lady Jane Grey
should be proposed as queen consort, the young
people do not seem to have come much in contact;
and despite that the Duke and Duchess of
Suffolk and the Lady Katherine were in London
very frequently during the reign of Edward VI,
there is no record of the Lady Katherine having
been to her cousin’s court, not even on the occasion
when her sister Jane figured rather prominently
at the revels given in honour of the queen dowager
of Scotland, when she passed through London
on her way northwards. Katherine was probably
too young; but there is a touching record extant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
proving that, notwithstanding a slight disparity in
age (only two years, however), a great affection
existed between Lady Jane Grey and her sister.</p>

<p>On Whit-Sunday (probably May 21) 1553,
the day on which Lady Jane became the bride
of Lord Guildford Dudley, Katherine was married,
or rather, contracted&mdash;she was only thirteen
years old at the time&mdash;to Henry, Lord Herbert,
eldest son of the Earl of Pembroke, who was
just a little over nineteen. After the ceremony (it
was no more than a ceremony), the very youthful
“bride” lived, according to custom, under her
father-in-law’s roof at Baynard’s Castle, the
ancient palace on the Thames, within the walls
of which Pembroke proclaimed his allegiance to
Mary on the last day of Queen Jane’s reign. Lady
Katherine, unlike her sister Jane, was not blessed
(or cursed) with a mother-in-law, for Anne Parr,
only sister of Queen Katherine Parr and mother
of Lord Herbert, had died some months before
her son’s marriage and her husband’s accession
to the rank of earl. The young “bride’s” father-in-law,
however, must have been the reverse of a
pleasant companion&mdash;his selfishness, craft, and
brutality, like his enormous wealth, were common
talk. When he expelled the abbess and nuns
from the royal abbey of Wilton, which had been
bestowed upon him by Henry VIII, he is said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
have struck some of them with his whip, exclaiming,
“Go spin, ye jades, go spin!” Like the
majority of his peers, indeed, he was a staunch
Protestant under Edward VI, a “Janeite” for
something near nine days, and, when Mary came
to the Throne, so fervent a Catholic that he actually
invited the nuns of Wilton to return to
their old home, and stood bareheaded as they
filed into it in his presence.</p>

<p>Lady Katherine Grey was still at Baynard’s
Castle during the whole of the last days of the
tragic existence of her unfortunate sister, and was
not, as usually stated, at Sheen. The more
minute details of what had befallen Lady Jane
may have been spared her; but surely she must
have been acquainted with the general outline
of what was happening to her father and mother
and to the victim of their ambition, the “Nine-days’
Queen.” There is no evidence, however,
that during the time Lady Jane was on the Throne,
Lady Katherine Grey ever entered the Tower,
and she certainly never saw her sister again; but
she was remembered by her in one of the most
exquisite letters of the period.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
The letter runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I have sent you, good sister Katherine,
a book [i.e. the Testament], which, though
it be not outwardly trimmed with gold, yet
inwardly it is of more worth than precious
stones. It is the book, dear sister, of the laws
of the Lord; it is His Testament and last
Will, which He bequeathed to us poor
wretches, which shall lead us to the path of
eternal joy; and if you, with good mind and
an earnest desire, follow it, it will bring you
to immortal and everlasting life. It will
teach you to live&mdash;it will teach you to die&mdash;it
will win you more than you would have
gained by the possession of your woeful
father’s lands, for if God had prospered him
ye would have inherited his lands.</p>

<p>“If ye apply diligently to this book, trying
to direct your life by it, you shall be inheritor
of those riches as neither the covetous shall
withdraw from you, neither the thief shall
steal, nor the moth corrupt. Desire, dear
sister, to understand the law of the Lord
your God. Live still to die, that you by
death may purchase eternal life, or, after your
death, enjoy the life purchased for you by
Christ’s death. Trust not that the tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of your age shall lengthen your life, for
as soon as God will, goeth the young as
the old. Labour alway and learn to die.
Deny the world, defy the devil, and despise
the flesh. Delight only in the Lord. Be
penitent for your sins, but despair not. Be
steady in your faith, yet presume not, and
desire, with St. Paul, to be dissolved, to be
with Christ, with Whom, even in death, there
is life. Be like the good servant, and even
in midnight be waking, lest when death
cometh, he steal upon you like a thief in the
night, and you be, with the evil servant,
found sleeping, and lest for lack of oil ye be
found like the first foolish wench,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and like
him that had not the wedding garment, ye
be cast out from the marriage. Persist ye
(as I trust ye do, seeing ye have the name of
a Christian), as near as ye can, to follow the
steps of your Master, Christ, and take up
your cross, lay your sins on His back, and
always embrace Him!</p>

<p>“As touching my death, rejoice as I do,
and adsist [i.e. consider] that I shall be
delivered from corruption and put on incorruption,
for I am assured that I shall,
for losing a mortal life, find an immortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
felicity. Pray God grant that ye live in
His fear and die in His love....<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> neither for
love of life nor fear of death. For if ye deny
His truth to lengthen your life, God will
deny you and shorten your days, and if ye
will cleave to Him, He will prolong your days,
to your comfort, and for His glory, to the
which glory God bring mine and you hereafter,
when it shall please Him to call you.</p>

<p>“Farewell, dear sister; put your only trust
in God, Who only must uphold you.</p>

<p class="pr4">“Your loving sister,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Jane Duddely</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Shortly after the “Nine-days’ Queen’s” execution,
the Earl of Pembroke, true to his callous
nature, and so as to avoid any suspicion of having
supported the fallen cause, forced his son to annul
his engagement with Lady Katherine, on the plea
that it had been a mere formality, and that the
bride had been at the time betrothed to the young
Earl of Hertford&mdash;a curious statement, certainly,
when considered in the light of subsequent events.
Camden says that she was officially “divorced,”
but this is not probable, there having been no
marriage beyond a mere ceremony of contract.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
It was therefore simply annulled, and the bride,
who, according to the custom of the period,
had gone to live with her husband’s parents, in
order the better to form her future husband’s
acquaintance, was sent back to her mother.
Strange to say, five years later (March 24,
1559), the Count de Feria wrote to King Philip
of Spain stating that “Lady Katherine has been
hitherto very willing to marry the Earl of Pembroke’s
son, but she has ceased to talk about it
as she used to. The Bishop will have told Your
Majesty what passed between the Earl of Pembroke
and me on this matter.” It is easy to
understand that Pembroke, recognizing Katherine’s
position in respect to the succession, may
have eventually regretted the over-hasty dissolution
of his son’s betrothal, and desired that
so advantageous a marriage should take place;
but why Katherine, at that time engaged to the
Earl of Hertford, should have favoured Pembroke’s
son, is hard to say, unless she was suddenly
temporarily jealous or annoyed with her <i>fiancé</i>,
or was simply <i>pretending</i> to approve of Pembroke’s
plan, in order to distract attention from her real
engagement to the earl, which it was advisable
to keep secret.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Lady Katherine returned to the
maternal roof from Baynard’s Castle than she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
had to undergo the trying ordeal of hearing of the
executions of her father and uncle, and of witnessing
the callous manner in which these tragedies
were treated by her mother. The Lady Frances’s
mourning for her husband or her daughter could
not have been of long duration, for well within
the first three weeks of her widowhood, regardless
of the tragic fate of her daughter, her husband,
and her brother-in-law, this heartless woman
put aside her mourning robes, and, gaily attired,
allowed herself to be led to the hymeneal altar
by a ginger-headed lad of twenty-one, young
enough to be her son and of such inferior rank that
the Princess Elizabeth, in her indignation at so
unequal a match, cried out: “What? Has the
woman so far forgotten herself as to mate with a
common groom!” “A common groom,” however,
Mr. Stokes was not. He was a member of
a fairly good yeoman family and had been appointed
secretary and groom of the chambers
to the princess some two years earlier, during
which time he must not only have won her confidence,
but been on terms of so unusually intimate
a kind, that had his first child been born alive,
which fortunately it was not, it might have
claimed the paternity of the Duke of Suffolk, and
have added another complication to the many
as to the succession, the result of the irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
wills<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> made by Henry VIII and Edward VI, who
both appointed the Lady Frances and her daughters
the immediate heiresses to the Throne, in the
event of the deaths without issue of the former
king’s daughters, Elizabeth and Mary. Perhaps
the real reason why Lady Jane Grey never wrote
to her mother in the last months of her life and
never mentioned her in the letters to her sister
Katherine and to her father, nor even on the
margin of the Prayer Book (still in the possession
of the nation) in which she has recorded her
last thoughts, was that she was well aware of
some scandal attaching to the Lady Frances in
connection with the “base-born” Mr. Adrian
Stokes. There are portraits, both in one canvas,
facing each other, of Mr. Adrian Stokes and the
Lady Frances, at Chatsworth. The gentleman
is distinctly plain and common looking&mdash;he might
indeed be a groom, with his ginger hair, his colourless
eyes and rather silly expression. He wears
a very rich doublet of black velvet, furred with
ermine; whereas the Lady Frances, a buxom, but
sour and ill-tempered looking lady, bearing a
strange resemblance to her uncle, Henry VIII, is
attired in a dress of black satin, with a jewelled
pattern. She wears the well-known Mary Stuart
coif and some fine jewels. In the corner of the
picture figures the date “1555” and the words,
“Adrian Stokes, aged twenty-one, and Lady
Frances Duchess of Suffolk, aged thirty-six”&mdash;she
looks fully ten years older.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The question arises, Why did Lady Frances
marry Mr. Stokes? The match appeared, even
at that time, an incredible breach of common
decency. Was it a love-passion; or was it not
rather the result of well pondered policy?
The Lady Frances might easily have been selected
as the head of one or other of the numerous parties
then existing in England, in order that she should
become a possible successor or even rival to Queen
Mary. The fact that she was the wife of a “base-born
knave” made it almost an impossibility
that she could be used as a tool against the queen.
The people would never have accepted her as a
ruler, nor would they have allowed her offspring,
notwithstanding the example of Katherine of
Valois and Owen Tudor, to have succeeded to the
Throne. This was the view of the case taken,
even at the time, at court; for the French ambassador
speaks of it as simply a move on the
part of the Lady Frances to get herself tacitly
excluded from the succession, and thereby enable
her to lead a peaceful existence. It may be
remarked here that nearly all the greatest court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
ladies of the late King Edward’s reign, including
the Duchess of Somerset and Katherine, Duchess
of Suffolk, married men who were their inferiors
by birth and station. Katherine, Duchess of
Suffolk, married her youthful secretary, Mr.
Bertie; and Mr. Newdigate, Anne Stanhope,
Duchess of Somerset’s secretary, became, in due
course, that haughty lady’s husband.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c107" id="c107">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="pch">LADY KATHERINE GREY AT THE COURT OF
QUEEN MARY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Agnes Strickland</span> and other historians
have fallen into the error of stating that Mary
Tudor appointed the Lady Frances, Duchess of
Suffolk, to be one of her women of the bedchamber,
and her two daughters, the Ladies
Katherine and Mary Grey, maids of honour. A
little reflection will show that such appointments
were as impossible in Mary’s time, as it would be,
in our day, for Her present Majesty, to name the
Duchess of Fife and her children, or the Princess
Louise, Duchess of Argyll, to similar positions in
her household. The Ladies Grey were royal
princesses and possible successors to the reigning
sovereign. Mary, therefore, simply restored to
the royal Duchess of Suffolk her rights of precedence
and <i>entrée</i> at court, which had been withdrawn
on account of her share in the conspiracy
to place her daughter, the Lady Jane Grey, upon
the Throne. A note among the Willoughby
Papers (1556) probably gave rise to the error<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in question, by stating that “Mrs. Margaret
Willoughby has been to Court with the Lady
Frances’ Grace, who has her place in the Privy-chamber.
Young Mistress Willoughby was much
commended, and the Lady Frances’ Grace did not
doubt but, in a short time, to place her about the
Queen’s highness, so as to content all her friends.”
This, however, merely confirms what we have
said above. Throughout her reign, owing to ill-health,
Queen Mary received not only her intimate
friends, but even ambassadors and other official
persons, in her bed-chamber, whilst she lay,
propped up with cushions, in the bed.</p>

<p>The Lady Frances, after her ill-assorted
marriage, lived with her young husband at Sheen,
but came up to London to her house in the Strand
(which she had not as yet sold, and on the site of
which Northumberland House was subsequently
built) whenever it suited her purpose to visit
the queen or her other royal relatives. Though
the Ladies Katherine and Mary Grey were not
exactly “received” into the queen’s household&mdash;their
rank forbade it&mdash;they accompanied the
queen wherever she went, and lodged in the royal
palaces. Mary did not wish the sisters of Lady
Jane Grey to be far out of her sight and reach,
lest they might be involved in some attempt to
place either of them, and especially the Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Katherine, at the head of the Protestant party, in
the position left vacant in so tragic a manner by
their sister Jane. Mary, and after Mary’s death,
Elizabeth in her turn, paid each sister a pension
of eighty pounds a year; but this was a bounty,
not a salary. After the deaths of their father,
uncle, and sister, the estates of the Greys, at
Bradgate and elsewhere, were confiscated, and
eventually passed by entail to the next male heir,
Lord Grey of Pirgo; and therefore the inheritance
of the two sisters from their father was lost to
them and never restored. It was otherwise with
the Lady Frances, whose property, although considerably
diminished by mortgages and loans,
was never confiscated; but the rents only sufficed
for her own maintenance and that of her young
husband. As to her daughters, this sinister lady
does not seem to have troubled much about them.
She apparently left their interests to Providence&mdash;and
the queen. Lady Katherine Grey and her
little sister were treated with consideration at
the court of Queen Mary, and granted the state
and precedence due to princesses of the blood, as
is clearly indicated in the records of the time, by
an apparently trivial mention, that “their trains
were upheld by a gentlewoman” on all great
occasions, a privilege only accorded to members of
the royal family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The contrast between the secluded life which
she had led at Baynard’s Castle, and the court
of Queen Mary, must have been great, and
afforded, to a very young girl of Katherine’s age,
sufficient amusement to make her forget the
sorrows through which she had recently passed.
The Duke of Somerset, when protector, had
reduced the household expenses of Edward VI
to about half what they had been in the reign
of his father, Henry VIII. Queen Mary, being
economically inclined, although aware that she
must make a great figure if she wished to captivate
Philip of Spain, did not restore things to the splendid
state in which they had been in her father’s
time. She reduced the number of her servants
and attendants, but in a measure increased the
splendour of their costumes. Like her sister
Elizabeth, she was inordinately fond of dress, with
this difference, however, that she had perfect taste;
and fortunately for her, fashion was not then as
grotesque as it became later on, when good Queen
Elizabeth wore farthingales four yards in circumference,
and a ruff that gave her head the appearance
of being in the centre of her body. Mary’s
household was ordered almost on monastic lines.
Mass every morning, saying the rosary, evening
and night prayers, and pious readings took up
much of the ladies’ time. They were, moreover,
expected to accompany the queen to hear innumerable
sermons, and to follow her in the countless
religious processions which were now revived with
exaggerated zeal. The queen, it is true, occasionally
indulged in a stately measure, was fond of
music and not a little, also, of cards; but until the
advent of Philip, her court was as decorous as it
was dull.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Katherine Grey’s first appearance at the
court of the queen, her cousin, was on the occasion
of Mary’s marriage to Philip of Spain in July
1554, when she is mentioned as being among the
ladies who rode in that startling red-lacquered
chariot, lined with crimson velvet and specially
constructed for the purpose, that so delighted
contemporaries, and conveyed Her Majesty and
her ladies over the very rough roads between
London and Winchester, rendered still more dreadful
by an almost incessant downpour of rain which
had lasted for some weeks. The queen and her
suite reached Winchester on Monday, July 23, on
the same day that Prince Philip left Southampton,
where he had landed, after seven days’ rough
voyage from Corunna, on Thursday, July 19.
At Southampton he had been lodged in the palace,
specially adorned with tapestries sent down from
London. The decorations of his bedroom puzzled
and displeased him not a little, for it was hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
with crimson velvet embroidered “in many places”
with the arms of England, bordered with scrolls
on which figured the words, “Defender of the
Faith and Head of the Church,” in raised letters
of gold and silver, interlaced with the roses of York
and Lancaster. Philip, a belligerent Catholic,
did not like himself in the character of “Defender
of the [Protestant] Faith” or as “Head” of the
Protestant or any other church. The people of
Southampton seem to have been delighted with
the personal appearance of the Spanish prince;
contemporary documents describe him as possessing
a “bright complexion,” which he certainly
had not in ordinary life, and we may therefore
conclude that he rouged for the occasion&mdash;a
by no means unusual practice, even with men,
in those days. Titian and Coelho have depicted
Philip, and it would be hard to find a more unpleasing
countenance than that of this Prince of
Naples, soon (1556) to be King Philip II of Spain
and emperor of half the known world; a strangely
shaped conical head, a prematurely wrinkled forehead,
a chubby nose with large nostrils, and a protruding
underlip, made up a most unprepossessing
face, not even relieved by fine eyes, but merely
by a pair of grey ones that rather emphasized than
otherwise the sodden complexion of a gentleman
who was, however, nothing like so unpleasant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
his manners as we have been led to fancy him.
He was, at least at this period of his life, neither
mean nor morose, but exceedingly alert, liberal,
and courteous, even to menials. He arrived in
England in the best of tempers, which was, however,
sorely tried during his short journey from
Southampton to Winchester, performed, with a
very numerous escort, on horseback. The roads
were wretched, the rain and wind incessant, and
at a given point, some three miles before reaching
Winchester, the prince’s horse shied, and Philip,
Infante of Spain, Viceroy of Naples, Sicily, Austria,
Flanders and the Indies, East and West, was sent
sprawling, like an ordinary mortal, into a mud-heap,
whence he emerged in such a filthy condition,
that he had to be conveyed into a hut, washed,
cleaned and furbished up generally for the rest
of his ride. He reached Winchester towards
evening, where he dined alone. He was then
dressed afresh, the better to make a favourable
impression upon the royal bride, who awaited
him with the utmost impatience at the Bishop’s
palace. When he entered the great hall, the
queen, gorgeously robed in white satin embroidered
in silver, with a train of blue velvet, greeted him
with every demonstration of affection. Philip
himself was in white velvet, slashed with cloth of
silver. He moreover wore a short cloak of black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
velvet, embroidered in gold with a design of
pomegranates. A little before reaching Winchester,
His Highness had been met at the wayside by
a gentleman on horseback, bearing a ring from the
queen, as a token of her regard, which ring Philip
took great care to wear, and even to point to, when
he first beheld Her Majesty. There had, however,
been some trouble over the matter of the ring, for
Lord Pembroke, who had been selected to convey
it to the prince, spoke neither French, Italian,
nor Spanish. Pembroke’s speech on delivering
the said ring was either misunderstood or wrongly
translated, and Philip came to the conclusion that
it was intended to warn him of some plot or other
against him, for he was well aware of the intense
dislike to the marriage entertained by the majority
of the English; and he even prepared to turn back.
He, however, called the Duke of Alva and Count
Egmont to him, and passing for shelter under the
dripping boughs of a tree, consulted with them.
Pembroke was now called also, and after a good
deal of pantomiming, it was made clear that the
ring was simply a matter of compliment, and not
a warning; and thus, greatly relieved, the brilliant
company galloped on, through the blinding wind
and rain, as fast as their horses could speed. As
the queen spoke Spanish fluently, no doubt Philip
described this incident to her, and maybe it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
explains why, shortly after the prince had entered
her presence, Mary was observed to be laughing
heartily as she conversed with him.</p>

<p>The marriage of the Queen of England to the
Prince of Naples and Spain took place in Winchester
Cathedral on July 25, being the Feast
of St. James. Mary walked from the episcopal
palace to the church, her cousin, the Lady
Margaret Douglas (Lennox), carrying her train,
assisted by Sir John Gage, the chamberlain.
Behind her walked Lady Katherine Grey, “her
train upheld by a gentlewoman.” Then came the
queen’s favourite women: the Lady Browne, Mrs.
Jane Dormer, Mrs. Clarencieux, the Lady Bacon,
Mrs. Sands, the beautiful Lady Magdalen Dacre,
Mrs. Mary Finch, Jane Russell, Mrs. Shirley, and
many others. In the chancel were assembled the
distinguished Spanish noblemen and women who
had accompanied the prince from Spain. The
tall, majestic, but sinister-looking Duke of Alva,
with his fine features, steely grey eyes, and long
forked grey beard, must have been the observed
of all observers, for he was already renowned and
dreaded as a formidable opponent of the Reform.
The handsome Count Egmont was also a conspicuous
personage in the prince’s foreign escort.
Within a few short years, together with his friend,
Count Horne, he was to be amongst Alva’s most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
famous victims, and eventually to be immortalized
in a tragedy by Schiller and an overture by
Beethoven. After the wedding ceremony, performed
by Dr. Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, the
illustrious company walked processionally to the
episcopal palace, where a copious banquet was
served, the royal table being furnished with plate
of solid gold. A cupboard of nine stages, full of
gold vases and silver dishes, was placed well in
sight, for ornament rather than for use. In a
gallery opposite was stationed a band of musicians,
who played a selection of English and Spanish
tunes; after which, four heralds, attired in their
official tabards, entered, and between the first
and the second courses, one of them, after much
trumpeting, pronounced a congratulatory Latin
panegyric in the queen’s honour and in that of
the Prince of Naples, which was received with
tumultuous applause, though we may take it for
granted that nine-tenths of the audience did not
understand a word of what had been said! At
what we should call the dessert, a group of Winchester
boys pressed forward and grouped themselves
round their head-boy, who read a Latin
epithalium<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> of his own composition. The queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
then most graciously introduced the lads to the
prince, and they were all of them rewarded by
Her Majesty and His Highness with gold and
silver coins, tied up in little red bags. At the
close of the banquet, Prince Philip rose and
returned thanks to the Lords of the Privy Council
and to the other English nobility present. At six
o’clock the tables were cleared and taken up, and a
little later the queen, who had retired for about an
hour, returned to the hall, accompanied by her
women, and spoke very graciously to the Spanish
ladies. Among these were the Duchess of Alva,
the Countess Egmont, the Countess Horne, the
Countess of Villhermosa, the Duquesa de las Neves,
and many others, whose costumes were deemed so
extraordinary and ludicrous by the English ladies
that they had the greatest difficulty to conceal
their merriment. We can imagine how the little
Lady Katherine Grey must have been diverted by
the comical spectacle presented by the towering
form of the Duchess of Alva, a very large and tall
woman, attired in one of those gigantic farthingales
with which Velazquez has made us familiar.
It seems that the Duchess of Alva’s huge petticoat
was embroidered in a design of parrots and
squirrels pecking at cherries and oranges and other
fruits, and even nuts: the whole on a ground of gold
thread. No doubt it was a marvellous specimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of needlework, but when taken in conjunction
with a formidable ruff of gold lace and a headdress
so peculiar as to baffle description, the
presence of the august lady was well calculated to
astonish and divert her English hosts, who were
attired in the tasteful costume of the period. The
Spanish ladies, who did not dance the English
dances, after much ado consented to execute a
Spanish fandango, to the amused delight of the
queen and the court of England.</p>

<p>What became of Lady Katherine Grey immediately
after the marriage of the queen is not
recorded. From Winchester the royal couple
went to Basing Hall for their honeymoon, where
they were splendidly entertained by the Marquis
of Winchester; but as the suites of the queen
and her consort were, to use Dominie Sampson’s
expression, “prodeegious,” both in quality and
quantity, a large contingent of them rode on to
London to await their majesties’ arrival. After a
week at Basing Hall, the royal couple, with their
courts, proceeded, in mended weather, to Windsor.
The cavalcade consisted of fifty-two of the lumbering
but vividly painted coaches then in vogue,
containing about a dozen persons each: that
occupied by the prince and the queen, who sat
opposite each other precisely as they would have
done in an omnibus, was the only one painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
scarlet. The passage of the royal party and their
suite through the hamlets, villages, and small
towns on the way, created, we may be sure, a
delightful impression upon the country-folks, unaccustomed
to seeing so many gay coaches, litters,
cavaliers, and horsemen. Long before the interminable
cortège reached Windsor, the sun shone
out gloriously, as the noble silhouette of the
incomparable castle, with its round and square
towers rising majestically from the midst of its
delicious surroundings of every tint of verdure,
burst upon the delighted English and the surprised
Spaniards, who had no conception that England&mdash;which,
according to their letters home, they
considered a land of barbarians&mdash;contained any
palace so superb: one that coul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
until August 27, in that fair riverside palace,
of which, unfortunately, so little has survived.
On the morning of that day, Philip and Mary, in
their state barges, escorted by nearly a hundred
other craft, some of them manned by as many as
forty oarsmen, rowed down the river to Suffolk
Place, Southwark, where they spent the night
before making their state entry into London.
In those days, Suffolk Place, of which only a
memory remains in the name of a mean court, was
one of the most magnificent Tudor residences in
England. It had been inherited by the queen’s
uncle, Charles Brandon, from his uncle Thomas,
and sumptuously furnished for the reception of
the queen-dowager, Mary Tudor. In the reign of
Edward VI it was converted into a mint, but was
now refurnished for the reception of Prince Philip.
It is not likely that either the Lady Frances, or
her daughters Katherine and Mary, were included
in the state procession that started for Westminster
from Suffolk Place early in the morning of the
28th of August. The tragedy of Lady Jane was
too fresh in the minds of the people for it to be
prudent to recall it too forcibly by the presence
in a public function of the mother and sisters of
the numerous victims. The state entry of Philip
and Mary into the metropolis must have been very
curious, if only on account of the number of giants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
which, for some unexplained reason, formed part
of the usual pageants along the road: their
towering height contrasted sharply with the very
diminutive stature of the queen. Of greater
interest probably to the people of London than
this state entry was another procession which
passed through the streets some months later,
bearing to the Tower no less than ninety-seven iron
chests, each a yard and a quarter in length, and
reported to contain a quantity of Spanish silver,
which, says Machyn, “will mak by estymacyon
1 thousand pounds.” These chests were carried
in carts specially constructed for the purpose, and
guarded by Spaniards in rich liveries, and were
greeted, so it was noted, with greater enthusiasm
than was shown for either the prince or the queen.
Naturally the people were well pleased to see so
tangible a proof that the national exchequer,
which had been emptied by Henry VIII and by
the protector, under Edward VI, was being thus
replenished by the otherwise intolerable Spaniards.</p>

<p>Unhappily, in the midst of the coronation
festivities, the old Duke of Norfolk died; and in
deference to his memory, the queen, who was
probably very tired herself of these rejoicings,
ordered that they should be suspended for some
time. The court therefore proceeded to Hampton
Court, where it arrived on August 23<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
(1554), and was met, we know, by Lady Katherine
Grey, because a few days after their highnesses’
arrival, an important incident in the life
of this young lady occurred&mdash;i.e. her meeting,
after some years’ separation, with young Edward
Seymour, Earl of Hertford, the late Duke of
Somerset’s eldest son, who at one time had been
much attached to Lady Jane Grey. He was not a
very desirable suitor, it may be, for so great a lady
as Katherine, since, besides being not very well off&mdash;having
been deprived of his father’s lands and
titles&mdash;he was so undersized that he was generally
called “little Hertford”; whilst, as we shall see
later on, he seems to have possessed a timorous
and vacillating character.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the king and queen retired to a
suite of beautiful Gothic chambers, known as
“Paradise,” which were destroyed in the seventeenth
century, when this part of the palace was
rebuilt by William and Mary. Philip and Mary
shut themselves up for nearly a week, much to the
annoyance of the public, no one being admitted,
except such ladies-in-waiting and gentlemen as
were absolutely necessary for the service of the
royal table and bedchamber. These days of
peaceful seclusion were possibly the happiest of
Mary’s life: for she firmly believed Philip to be
in love with her, and he played up to her fancy as
deceitfully and skilfully as only he knew how. The
royal pair would sit for hours together hand in
hand, and even disappear down a private staircase,
to meander, with their arms round each other’s
waists, like the commonest of lovers, across the
lawns and the flower-bordered avenues of that
charming and still delightful garden. The queen
was infatuated, and firmly believed that in due
course she would give birth to a son and heir&mdash;had
not the fact been lately prophesied to her by
a famous soothsayer? Unfortunately, even thus
early in his married life, Philip exhibited his fickle
nature, in an amusing incident that moved the
court to merriment. Among the ladies in attendance
on Mary at this time was the beautiful Lady
Magdalen Dacre, a friend of Lady Katherine Grey
and of about her age. Her beaming face and her
bright eyes soon attracted the attention of Philip,
who watched an opportunity to pounce upon his
fair prey and kiss her, whereupon the fiery young
Englishwoman, breaking away from him, gave
him a resounding box on the ears. Philip took
his punishment prettily enough and made no
complaint; but the story of his defeat, spreading
like wildfire through the court, created much
amusement, and no doubt eventually reached Her
Majesty’s ears.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin Hume published, some years ago, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
very curious letter he found among the Spanish
archives, giving a description of the few happy
days Mary enjoyed with Philip, from which we
learn that the over numerous Spaniards who
accompanied the prince were as much disgusted
with the English as the English were with them.
Left somewhat to themselves, thanks to the
love-making of their sovereign, they made themselves
masters of Hampton Court. They could not
endure the cooking; it was, they said, coarse, raw,
and horrible. The famous “roast-beef of old
England” was unsuited to their palates, and their
stomachs revolted at the quantity of strong beer
which the attendants upon Mary imbibed so
copiously that, according to the correspondent in
question, by the time evening drew on, the majority
of them were drunk. Further, this correspondent
says: “There is not a single Spanish gentleman
here who would give a farthing for any of their
women; and, to speak plainly, they care equally
little for us Spaniards. The English, in fact, hate
us as they do the devil, and in that spirit they treat
us. If we go up to town to make purchases, we
are sure to be cheated, and it is quite dangerous
for us to venture into the country. As to their
women, with few exceptions, they are most plain,
very fat, and red in the face. They dress extremely
badly, and shuffle rather than walk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
There are eighteen kitchens in this royal palace,
and every day there are consumed not less than
one hundred sheep, twelve oxen, eighteen calves,
and beer in such abundance, that the winter flow of
the river at Valladolid is not greater in quantity.”
The amusing writer then proceeds to describe the
queen. “Bless you,” says he, “she is a very
plain little lady, small, lean, with a pink-and-white
complexion and no eyebrows; very pious and very
badly dressed.” In this matter of the queen’s
dress our Spanish critic probably preferred the
Spanish fashion for ladies, with its “vastie”
farthingales and impossible head-dress, to the rich
but sober costume which Queen Mary affected.</p>

<p>Whilst Philip and Mary were spending an idyllic
existence in the pleasant seclusion and surroundings
of their sequestered apartments, the ladies
of the court no doubt availed themselves of the
opportunity to enjoy a greater amount of freedom
than court etiquette usually allows; and thus it
came to pass than young Hertford and Lady
Katherine met almost daily, either in the garden
or in the palace itself, thereby adding fuel to the
fire of that attachment between them which was
eventually to prove so disastrous to both. That
the Duchess of Somerset, the lad’s mother, was
aware of their love-making appears pretty certain,
and probably Mary herself was cognizant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
it, and by no means disapproved. She felt sure
she would become the mother of an heir to
the Throne, and it mattered very little to her
whom the Lady Katherine married, provided he
was of sufficient rank. Notwithstanding that his
mother, the duchess, was a very outspoken Protestant,
Queen Mary always entertained a great
affection for her, addressing her, in her numerous
letters, as her “Dearest Nan.” Indeed the early
courting of Lady Katherine and Hertford was
spent under the most auspicious circumstances,
smiled upon by the queen and amidst the most
charming and romantic surroundings.</p>

<p>On the 28th of September the court removed
from Hampton Court and went to Westminster
Palace, and with it went Lady Katherine and all
the ladies, young and old; and there is a record
that, on the 30th of the month, the Lady Frances
came up to town and paid her respects to the queen
and her consort. She probably attended their
highnesses to St. Paul’s, where the whole court
listened to a sermon preached by Gardiner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Spaniards, who had flocked to
London in great numbers, were the cause of
perpetual trouble to the citizens and to themselves.
Street fights between them and the English were
of constant occurrence, and all sorts of brawls, as
picturesque, no doubt, as they were unpleasant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
between the English gentlemen and the Spanish
cavaliers, and Spanish valets and London apprentices,
occurred almost daily&mdash;and especially
nightly. Probably London felt itself well quit of
this foreign invasion when the greater part of it
followed Philip, on his return to Spain in August
1555, leaving the queen at Greenwich in the deepest
despondency. Before this, the Lady Katherine
Grey had formed an intimacy with the two daughters
of the late Duke of Somerset, the Ladies
Margaret and Jane Seymour, who had been
appointed maids of honour to the queen. They
are described as very good-looking young women,
and Jane was even considered to be one of the
most learned of her time. Shortly after the
departure of Prince Philip, Lady Jane Seymour,
who was very delicate, fell ill, and the queen
allowed Lady Katherine to go with her to her
mother, the Duchess of Somerset’s house at
Hanworth, which Mary had recently restored to
her, and where the young Earl of Hertford was
staying. As may be imagined, the courting which
had begun at Hampton Court was continued, with
renewed vigour, at Hanworth, Lady Jane Seymour
being Lady Katherine’s confidante.</p>

<p class="pch">THE PROGRESS OF LADY KATHERINE’S LOVE
AFFAIRS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> happiest years of Lady Katherine’s life
were, according to her own account, those spent
at the court of Queen Mary. She was too well
versed in the politics of the time not to recognize
that the queen’s action with respect to her sister
Jane was not a matter of private revenge but of
public policy, approved and indeed endorsed by
her Parliament. She bore witness, in after years,
to the kindness and consideration she had received
from Queen Mary, and the precedence accorded
to her on all state occasions as a princess of the
blood, allowing her to walk before any of the other
great ladies of the court, excepting the Princess
Elizabeth, the Lady Frances, and Henry VIII’s
fourth wife and only surviving widow, Anne of
Cleves. Queen Mary, unlike her successor Elizabeth,
insisted upon her ladies and maids of honour
paying the utmost attention to their religious
duties, and was, moreover, very vigilant as to
their manners and their morals. So long as her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
health permitted, together with all her court, she
heard Mass every morning in the palace chapel,
or in her bedroom, when she was ill. Very
frequently she attended Vespers, together with all
her court, besides taking her part in those numerous
religious processions&mdash;which had been suppressed
since her father’s reign&mdash;round the cloisters of
Westminster Abbey and the courtyards of her
palaces, on saints’ days and holy days. Of an
evening, when at needlework with her ladies,
hymns and litanies were sung; so that King
Philip, notwithstanding his zeal for the Church,
was somewhat depressed by so much piety, when
he returned to England in 1556, and observed that
“his wife’s court was now become like that of
some abbess, there was so much praying and
psalm-singing.” No doubt, Lady Katherine Grey
joined in all these pious exercises, and it was even
reported that, at this period, she followed her
mother’s example, and reverted to the Church of
Rome. She was certainly not a very staunch
Protestant, since she told Feria that she was “as
good a Catholic as any.”</p>

<p>At the court of Queen Mary, Lady Katherine
Grey formed one or two interesting friendships.
She kept up her connection with Mrs. Saintlow,
who, however, does not seem to have troubled
Queen Mary overmuch with her presence; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
she became intimate with Jane Dormer, Countess
de Feria, an extremely beautiful young woman,
belonging to a very ancient Catholic family, for
whom the queen entertained a great affection.
This lady has left a book of memoirs, printed
some fifty years ago, which contains many interesting
details of life at the court of England
under the rule of Mary Tudor. This friendship
between Katherine Grey and the Countess of Feria
proved dangerous, since it placed the former in
immediate communication with the Spanish ambassador,
and led to her being compromised in one
of the most remarkable plots of the many connected
with the succession that rendered Elizabeth’s life
a misery to her. So great was the influence of the
Ferias over Lady Katherine that, in March 1559,
the count could write to King Philip triumphantly
stating that she had actually given him her
solemn promise that she would not marry without
his consent, nor change her religion, which points
to the fact that, as we have said above, she had
become a Catholic. Another of Lady Katherine’s
intimates at this time was Surrey’s “Fair Geraldine,”
the beautiful Lady Clinton, who, although
a professed Protestant, was beloved by Queen
Mary, who retained her in her privy-chamber,
together with Lady Bacon and one or two other
ladies who approved of the Reformation. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
had married, when very young, the elderly Sir
Anthony Browne, who was master of the horse to
Henry VIII, and had been left by him a rich
widow. Her second husband was Lord Clinton,
who in due time became Earl of Lincoln. Lady
Katherine held her in such high esteem that she
bequeathed her a legacy in her will.</p>

<p>Of Katherine’s mode of life at Mary’s court
in the last years of that unhappy queen’s reign,
we know very little, beyond the fact that she is
occasionally mentioned as attending Her Majesty
on various state occasions; but we may rest assured
that she knew the cause of all the many sorrows
and troubles&mdash;the unrequited love, the failing
health of mind and body&mdash;that rendered those last
years of Mary’s life so gloomy and yet so pathetic,
during that fearful time when London was
lighted by the lurid flames of Smithfield. Lady
Katherine saw Queen Mary neglected by her
husband; she knew of the tragic story of the
dropsy mistaken for pregnancy, and as she was
with Mary during the last weeks of her life, she
must often have seen her sitting on the floor,
her hands clasping her knees and her forehead
resting upon them, her long grey hair streaming
round her. She would sit for hours thus,
silently nursing her knees; or lifting up her
face, would stare vacantly, her mind far away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in dreams, her eyes not recognizing even those
who stood nearest to her. When at last death
released this queen of woes from her suffering,
and her sister, who had been hastily summoned
from Hatfield, rode triumphantly to London to
succeed her and attend her obsequies, Lady Katherine
Grey and her sister Lady Mary walked from
St. James’s Palace to Westminster Abbey in the
solemn funeral procession of a queen who ought
to have been beloved, but who, owing to circumstances
beyond her control, died hated and
defamed as “Bloody Mary.”</p>

<p>During the last two years of Mary’s life, young
Hertford’s courtship of Lady Katherine Grey
progressed smoothly enough, approved by the
queen, by the Lady Frances and her husband,
and also, in a certain degree, by that shrewd virago,
his mother the Duchess of Somerset, who, however,
expressed some anxiety lest such an alliance might
eventually lead to “the undoing of her son.”
Had Mary lived, there is no doubt but that the
marriage would have taken place with state in
the presence of the queen and the whole court,
without the least let or hindrance.</p>

<p>After the funeral of Queen Mary, Lady Katherine
went to the Charterhouse, Sheen, to stay for a few
weeks with her mother, who was very ill at this
time&mdash;like unto death. Here the matter of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
betrothal to young Hertford was resumed with
renewed energy. The young gentleman was invited
to Sheen, where every opportunity was
afforded him, under the auspices of the Lady
Frances and her husband, Mr. Adrian Stokes, to
meet his <i>fiancée</i> and her little sister Lady Mary; but
nothing was concluded, the marriage being left
an open question, as the Lady Frances recovered
soon afterwards. Both the sisters were then
summoned back to the palace at Whitehall, where
Elizabeth gave them apartments, which they were
“to retain as their own, even when absent.”
Her Majesty received her young cousins with
some display of an affection which she certainly
never really felt for either of them. Katherine,
on the other hand, took the queen’s advances
coldly; she was annoyed, so she told Feria, that
Elizabeth refused to accept her as her successor,
and her dignity was hurt at the fact that the
queen had only made her one of her ladies of the
presence, “whereas she was in the privy-chamber
of the late queen, who showed her much favour.
The present queen,” he adds, “probably bears her
no goodwill.” Elizabeth thought it good policy,
however, to keep Lady Katherine, of whom she
was seriously afraid, near her, because, so far as
England was concerned, she was an even greater
danger to the safety of the Throne than was Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Stuart, since Lady Katherine’s position, in the
matter of the succession, was defined by two
royal wills, and by a special Act of Parliament;
whereas the Scotch queen’s was never confirmed,
either in the wills of Henry VIII or Edward VI,
nor by any Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth’s court formed a striking
contrast to that of her sister Mary. “Gloriana”
had restored all the extravagant magnificence of
Henry VIII’s time: all, save the supreme artistic
taste that distinguished the best period of the Renaissance,
but which had almost entirely died away
by the time of the accession of Elizabeth, whose
egregious farthingales, ridiculous ruffs and towering
head-dresses, disfigured herself and her courtiers,
and rendered them a laughing-stock to foreigners.
“This queen,” says the Venetian envoy, “exaggerates
everything in a manner so preposterous
that instead of inspiring awe, she excites laughter.
Her ruff is sometimes so high, that her face
appears to be in the middle of her body. She
wears more jewels than any other princess, but
as she has no discernment, they look tawdry and
valueless. She is a handsome woman, of dignified
carriage and fairly tall. Her face is oval, her
features aquiline; her eyes very black and piercing;
and her hair changes its colour, but is generally
red&mdash;to match her clothes.” Surrounded by
courtiers and ladies attired after a similar grotesque
fashion, “Gloriana” must indeed have
presented a marvellous spectacle, especially when
she was carried in a sort of palanquin borne by
six noblemen, that made her look for all the
world like a Hindu idol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Absorbed, therefore, in her political intrigues and
her private amusements, Elizabeth, who was the
strangest mixture of wisdom and folly that ever
occupied a throne, cared very little about her
ladies’ morals. Provided they were punctually
on hand whenever she wanted them, she was
content to allow them to go their own ways,
always, however, on the condition they created no
public scandal. Under these circumstances, Lady
Katherine Grey may have even preferred the greater
freedom allowed under the Elizabethan <i>régime</i>, to
the rigorous round of pious exercises that made up
the routine of court life under Queen Mary.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in March 1559, the Lady Frances
being still very sick, her daughters were once
more sent for, and, with the queen’s permission,
arrived at the Charterhouse at Sheen one windy
day towards evening. The scheme for the marriage
of Lady Katherine with young Hertford was
now revived with greater vigour than ever.</p>

<p>The Lady Frances was in such very bad health
that she evidently wished, before leaving this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
world, to provide her eldest surviving daughter
with a husband. The Lady Frances had
recently given birth to a child, which, notwithstanding
the attention and skill of Dr.
Wendy, had died almost as soon as it was
born; but although its mother failed to gain
strength, her mind continued very clear. Calling
one day the Lady Katherine and young Hertford
to her, she declared it was her opinion
that he (Hertford) “would make a very suitable
husband for her daughter Katherine, if the queen
would only see it in the same light; but she (the
Lady Frances) would have nothing to do with
the matter unless with the queen’s knowledge
and consent, and that of her honourable council.”
Mr. Stokes then drew Hertford aside, and taking
him into an inner room, held a consultation with
him. He thought, as the Lady Frances was so
near a kinswoman of the queen, it would be well
if she wrote Her Majesty a letter on the subject.
This advice pleased Hertford, and the two gentlemen
set to work to frame what they deemed a
suitable letter. They, however, considered it wise,
before obtaining the Lady Frances’s signature, to
consult Mr. Bertie, the husband of the other
dowager Duchess of Suffolk, Katherine Willoughby,
who had returned from his exile in Poland, and
who apparently expressed considerable sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
with the lovers. They therefore rode to London,
to the Barbican, where Duchess Katherine had her
house, and not only saw Mr. Bertie, but a Mr.
Gilgate and a Mr. Strikely, who were apparently
in the employ of the duchess and Mr. Bertie.
Whatever may have been their exact social position,
they were taken into the secret, as they were
probably necessary as witnesses to documents that
might have to be signed. The duchess and her
husband and all concerned considered it imperative
that, before any further steps were taken, Elizabeth
should be made aware of all that was going on,
and, if possible, conciliated and induced to countenance
the match. If these worthy people thought
that Elizabeth was likely to be “conciliated,” they
knew evidently very little about her, for of all the
happenings of this world, the one she dreaded most
was precisely the marriage of Lady Katherine and
her having children, for, as she observed later on,
“it was bad enough to have Lady Katherine to
deal with, let alone to endure her brats.” She
was determined, she added, “to keep the sisters
Grey, spinsters.” She bore no personal dislike
to either of them, if they would only do as she
wished, but if they were rebellious, she would be
obliged to act, in her own defence and in that of
the realm.</p>

<p>On their return to Sheen, Hertford and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Stokes found the Lady Frances much worse.
Greatly alarmed, they conceived it to be their duty
to act as promptly as possible. They were terribly
afraid of Elizabeth, and did not hesitate to say so,
even in the presence of the dying woman. They
advised the duchess to send at once for her
daughters, who had returned to court a few days
earlier. On informing Elizabeth that their mother
was not expected to live, the queen gave them
permission to go back immediately, sending them
in one of her own palanquins or litters. They
arrived to find the duchess propped up with
cushions, and looking very ill indeed. The Lady
Frances, taking Katherine’s hand in hers, and
stretching out her other hand to Hertford, said:
“Daughter Kate, I have found a husband for you,
if you like well to frame your fancy and good-will
in his direction.” On this the Lady Katherine
replied that she was very willing so to do, as she
loved Hertford very dearly. The Lady Frances,
thinking that a message from one who was so near
her end might influence the queen, called her
husband, Mr. Adrian Stokes, to her, and asked him
to frame a letter for her which should be delivered
to the queen, and he, bending over her, declared
that “he would be right glad to do so.” He then,
with the assistance of Hertford, wrote a draft of
the letter which was to be addressed to Elizabeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and which ran much as follows: “That such a
nobleman did bear good-will to her daughter the
Lady Katherine, and that she did humbly require
the Queen’s Highness to be good and gracious lady
unto her, and that it would please Her Majesty
to assent to the marriage of her to the said Earl,
which was the only thing she desired before her
death, and should be the occasion for her to die
the more quietly.” This draft of the letter,
which was never sent, was read out at the subsequent
trial which took place after the clandestine
marriage of the Lady Katherine with the Earl
of Hertford. Mr. Stokes on that occasion said:
“My Lord of Hertford would not let me send the
letter, for he took fright at the boldness of it and
said he would not care to meddle any more in the
matter.” Mr. Stokes did not seem to think this
was a very manly thing on Hertford’s part; but
Hertford was not manly, only a very small,
delicate, frail-looking young gentleman, who,
however, like so many other frail and sickly
looking youths, contrived to live to a very advanced
age. These occurrences took place somewhere in
March: throughout the spring and summer the
Lady Frances lingered on, a very sick woman,
rarely if ever rising from her bed or her couch,
but frequently visited by her daughters, who
brought her kind messages and gifts from Elizabeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
still in complete ignorance of the matrimonial
project. Hertford seems to have been a good
deal at Sheen, though nothing was determined as
to the marriage. It was apparently, under advice,
deemed safest to leave the whole concern in abeyance
until after the Lady Frances’s death; which
took place, in the fifty-fifth year of her age, in
the presence of her husband and children, on
the 20th November 1559. Elizabeth gave her
“beloved” cousin a right royal burial, worthy
of a princess of the blood. She was represented
by her chamberlain, and the court put on
the mourning usual for a member of the royal
family. The Ladies Katherine and Mary Grey
attended their mother’s funeral, “having their
trains upheld by gentlewomen.” Clarencieux
stood at the head of the coffin, and cried out, at a
given moment, in a loud voice: “Laud and praise
be to Almighty God, that it hath pleased Him to
call out of this transitory life into His eternal
glory, the most noble and excellent Princess, the
Lady Frances, late Duchess of Suffolk, daughter
to the right high and mighty Prince, Charles
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and of the most noble
and excellent Princess, Mary the French Queen,
daughter to the most illustrious King Henry VII.”
The Communion Service was then read in English,
and a carpet laid before the high altar for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
chief mourners to kneel upon. At the Communion,
the Ladies Katherine and Mary, kneeling upon this
carpet, received the Holy Communion, Dr. Jewel
having previously preached the usual panegyric.
When the service was over, Mr. Adrian Stokes, who
had been chief mourner, went back to the Charterhouse,
with his step-daughters, in the very chariot
that had borne the Lady Frances’s coffin to the
abbey: they literally returned on the hearse!
The Lady Frances is buried in St. Edmund’s
Chapel, on the south side of the abbey. Her tomb
is a handsome specimen of the art of the period,
and although considerably damaged, the likeness
between the face of the effigy and that in the
famous portrait is remarkable. Quite close to the
Lady Frances’s tomb is an upright figure of a
small girl, kneeling. Is this the tomb of her child
by Adrian Stokes, which died in infancy; or is it,
as Stow seems to imply, that of her daughter,
the dwarfish Lady Mary Grey? By her will, the
Lady Frances left all her possessions to her husband
for life, with reversion to her two daughters.
As Mr. Stokes outlived them both, they never inherited
much of their mother’s property, except
the proceeds of the sale of some land near Oxford
and of several other manors which were in her
possession at the time of her last illness, and
concerning the disposal of which she wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to Cecil some eight or ten days before her
death.</p>

<p>The Ladies Katherine and Mary Grey, on their
return to Westminster, found themselves in pecuniary
straits, although their embarrassment was, it
seems, relieved by Mr. Stokes, out of the money he
had received from his late wife’s executors. Elizabeth
welcomed her bereaved cousins with much
apparent sympathy. She was, or pretended to be,
most affectionate to them, and even called Lady
Katherine “her daughter,” although, as Quadra,
the Spanish ambassador, says, “the feeling
between them could hardly have been that of
mother and child.” “But,” he goes on to say,
“the Queen has thought best to put her [Lady
Katherine] in her chamber and makes much of
her in order to keep her quiet. She even talks
about formally adopting her.”</p>

<p>Whilst still in the early weeks of her mourning
for her mother, the Lady Katherine received
information that greatly distressed her. Young
Hertford, so she was told, had been paying his
addresses to the daughter of Sir Peter Mewtas,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
a piece of news that made her very jealous and
unhappy. Seeing the state of nervous prostration
into which Lady Katherine was thrown by Hertford’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
alleged infidelity, Lady Jane Seymour
insisted upon knowing what was the matter,
whereupon Katherine confessed to her tearfully
that she had heard there was love-making between
Mistress Mewtas and Lord Hertford. On the
following day, the Lady Jane obtained leave to go
to Hanworth, where Hertford was staying with
his mother, the Duchess of Somerset. She taxed
her brother, in no measured terms, with his lack
of fidelity to the Lady Katherine, to which he
replied that he knew nothing of the matter of the
daughter of Sir Peter Mewtas, that the whole
story was a falsehood, and that he was willing to
live or die for the sake of Lady Katherine. He
added that if she would but consent to marry him,
he was willing to defy Elizabeth, and he thought
that the sooner the marriage took place the
better; and so saying, he drew from his finger a
ring with a pointed diamond in it, and gave it to
his sister to carry to the Lady Katherine. Armed
with this bond of peace, Lady Jane Seymour
returned to London and found Lady Katherine,
to whom she gave the ring and her brother’s
message. “My little love, my little love,” said
Katherine, “well pleased am I that he should thus
treat me,” and drying her eyes, she became once
more her cheerful self.</p>

<p>Amongst Lady Katherine Grey’s friends at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
court of Elizabeth was a certain Mrs. Blanche
Parry,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> widow of Sir Thomas Parry, and a pupil,
in the occult arts, of the famous Dr. Dee.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Elizabeth
entertained for Blanche not only a great
affection, but also held her in a sort of awe. She
believed implicitly in her favourite’s powers, and
never a week passed that Blanche Parry was not
admitted to confidential interviews with her august
mistress, whose innermost secrets she possessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and, through her knowledge of palmistry, not only
shared, but even guided.</p>

<p>Blanche was a handsome and amiable woman,
who used her influence over her mistress to
the advantage of others as well as of herself.
One day, Lady Katherine asked her to
“do” her hand for her, and Blanche, who was
probably well aware of all that was going on
between young Hertford and her royal client,
told her: “The lines say, madam, that if you ever
marry without the queen’s consent in writing, you
and your husband will be undone, and your fate
worse than that of my Lady Jane.” Katherine
paid very little attention to the admonition, but
went her way to perdition blindly. In after years
she probably remembered Blanche Parry’s sagacious
advice, for she left her a legacy in her will,
as also did her sister, Lady Mary Grey, another of
Blanche’s clients and friends.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c146" id="c146">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p class="pch">QUEEN ELIZABETH AND HER SUCCESSION</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1560, Elizabeth’s position became
very precarious; her popularity was rapidly diminishing,
owing to the evil reports spread abroad
by her enemies, with respect to the nature of her
intimacy with the Lord Robert Dudley. The
Spanish ambassador wrote to King Philip, early
in the year, that he was amazed by “the new
queen’s flightiness,” and remarks that “there is no
understanding this woman. She will surely come
to trouble of her own making.” Elizabeth was
at her wits’ end to know exactly what to do.</p>

<p>Her equanimity was greatly disturbed by the
question of the succession, and she was advised
on all hands to marry, and by having an heir of
her own, so to speak, succeed herself. It was
freely bruited about&mdash;and the foreign envoys
frequently allude to the slander&mdash;that she was
already a mother, and many strange stories
were current concerning a daughter she had had
by Dudley, which was being brought up secretly.</p>

<p>Others said that the queen could never know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
maternity, although she herself, like her sister
Mary, seems to have believed that sooner or later
she would have offspring to succeed her, and it
was stated that this was the reason she steadfastly
refused, to the end, to nominate an heir.
When, in 1563, a deputation from the lords
waited upon her, to urge her to come to some
definite decision in the matter, Elizabeth rounded
on them fiercely, crying out that the marks
on her face were not wrinkles, but the pits of
small-pox, and that “although she might be old,
God could send her children as He did to Saint
Elizabeth.” She warned them to consider well
what they did in this affair of the succession,
“as if she declared a successor, it would cost
much blood to England.”</p>

<p>Yet for all her desire to have an heir of her own
body, Elizabeth was at heart loath to marry;
Philip of Spain had courted her, through his ambassadors
(she was already personally well acquainted
with him), but, remembering how miserable
her sister had been as his wife, she consistently
rejected his suit, saying that she “did
not think it was right before God for a woman to
marry her brother-in-law.” The rejected Philip
was none the less determined to secure paramount
Spanish influence in England, and wrote to Feria
proposing that the queen should be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to favour the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria,
his very Catholic brother. Elizabeth had lately
thrown over the Earl of Arundel, with whom she
had been flirting, and had repulsed the Italian,
Guido Cavalcanti, Catherine of Medici’s secret
agent, in his vicarious wooing on behalf of a French
prince, the Duc d’Alençon. Therefore there was
a fair chance that Elizabeth might at last have
yielded to persuasion and favoured the archduke’s
suit. Had Philip played his game firmly at this
juncture, most probably she would have fallen
an easy victim to his intrigues and have married
Ferdinand, whereby England would have lost,
for some time at least, her independence. At the
bottom of all the queen’s hesitation and perplexity
about her marriage was less the interests
of country than the violence of her headstrong
passion for Robert Dudley, still the husband of
that Amy Robsart who has been immortalized
by Sir Walter Scott in <i>Kenilworth</i>. On April 18,
1559, Feria wrote to Philip that he had heard
dreadful news concerning the queen’s conduct
with Dudley; it was all over the court, that they
slept in contiguous rooms&mdash;that she never let him
out of her sight. “Indeed,” the ambassador
continues, “I have heard such things of the
queen’s conduct with respect to the Lord Robert
that I dare not repeat them. Meanwhile, a rumour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
is circulating to the effect that Robert Dudley’s
wife, who is in the country, is sick of a malady
of the breasts and like to die.” On a close examination
of the documents connected with the
singular death of Amy Robsart,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> who by the way
was never Countess of Leicester, her husband
not being elevated to that rank for some considerable
time after her demise, we find no mention
whatever of this malady. The rumour was, therefore,
merely a feeler put forward to prepare
public opinion for coming events. Elizabeth
had made up her mind that, should the Lady
Robert Dudley conveniently depart this life at
an early date, she would marry the widower.
All these and many other open and covert attacks
on the queen’s character were damaging her
good name with the people, to such an extent,
indeed, that it was actually proposed to dethrone
her and to replace her by some more suitable successor.
The English Catholics naturally favoured
the Queen of Scots, but Katherine Grey was
preferred by Spain. King Philip, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
said, all his life certainly regretted the loss of
Spanish influence in English politics which came
to an end on the death of Queen Mary, and he
determined to regain it at any cost. That Lady
Katherine Grey, on account of her supposed
leaning towards Catholicism and her friendship
for the Ferias, was regarded by the Spanish
King as the most likely medium for realizing
his hopes, was well known.</p>

<p>As will be seen in the course of this biography,
many and curious were the intrigues, of which
Lady Katherine was the centre, for retrieving
Spanish ascendancy in the British Isles; but by
far the most astonishing and fantastic (and the
earliest) was a plot&mdash;evolved in 1558 or early in
1559&mdash;for secretly abducting Katherine to Spain.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
There she was to be married to Don Carlos, the
king’s son, or to the Archduke Ferdinand, or
some other Spanish prince, and put forward by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Philip as Elizabeth’s immediate successor or even
rival, her claims to the Throne being supported
by all the might of Spain, in opposition to those
of Mary Queen of Scots, the candidate favoured
by France. Apparently Philip, misled by his
ambassadors, who miscalculated the extent of
Elizabeth’s unpopularity, failed to realize how
strong was the anti-Spanish feeling which existed
in England, and did not perceive the enormous
difficulties which would have to be surmounted
before Katherine could be placed on the
Throne. Nor does he appear to have known that
she had also, strange to say, been selected by the
Evangelical, or Swiss, faction of the Protestants,
as their special champion. The Spaniards thought
Lady Katherine would not be unwilling to accept
the proposal to leave England, since she was said
to be very unhappy at home; Elizabeth, whatever
may have been her outward demonstrations
of affection, at heart disliked her, and Katherine
reciprocated this dislike, whilst it was thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that “neither her mother<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> nor her step-father
loved her, and her uncle (Lord John Grey) could
not abide her.” There was probably less grounds
for this latter statement; Katherine was not on
bad terms with her mother, who, as we have seen,
had done her best to further the marriage with
Hertford; there is no evidence that she ever
quarrelled with Mr. Stokes; and her uncle, Lord
John Grey, is known to have treated her kindly
when, some years later, she became a prisoner
in his house, although there had indeed been coldness
between them.</p>

<p>The Countess of Feria was considered the most
suitable person to approach Katherine with reference
to her leaving England; but meanwhile,
whether, as subsequent events indicate, Queen
Elizabeth knew of the plot and was determined
secretly to frustrate it, or whatever else the cause,
the bellicose Feria’s existence at the English court
was presently rendered so untenable, by reason
of the queen’s open hostility to him and above
all, to the countess, that by May 1559 he could
stand it no longer, and, inventing an excuse for
relinquishing his mission, forthwith returned to
Flanders; departing from London in such haste
that he left Durham House, Strand, then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Spanish Embassy, in the hands of his wife, who
seems to have had some sort of charge upon it.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Thus, the plot for Katherine’s abduction, of which,
it may be, that princess was entirely ignorant,
came to an abrupt conclusion, and was never,
so far as we know, revived during the embassy
of Feria’s successor, although Philip continued, by
less complicated means, to try to get Katherine
into his power. Elizabeth, however, could not
be brought to believe, as late as 1566, that the
original scheme had been abandoned. As there
is no mention of the matter in the Simancas
Papers, and we only hear of it through the English
ambassador at Madrid, it is probable that the
plot fell through immediately upon the departure
of Feria.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the open enmity of Queen
Elizabeth towards her, the Countess de Feria
remained at Durham House some months later
than her husband, packing up her own effects
and preparing the house for the new ambassador,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
who was a Roman Catholic Bishop&mdash;to wit, the
Neapolitan, Don Alvaro de la Quadra, created
Bishop of Venosa in 1542, and two years later
translated to the bishopric of Aquila in the
Kingdom of Naples, which see he resigned on his
appointment to the court of England. He was
a shrewd, clever man, and so broad-minded that
he actually wrote, during the debate upon the
Act for Conformity in Faith and Doctrine, the
following remarks&mdash;which might be endorsed by
a Liberal in our time: “It was,” he thought,
“natural that the Queen should wish to see
uniformity of belief throughout her Kingdom;
but,” he adds, “I see that she no longer wishes
to style herself Head of the Church, but simply
Governor. It is, however, unjust, but still possible,
to force a man to act as you will, but that he
should be obliged to <i>see</i> things in the same light
as his King is simply absurd. Yet they are so
ignorant here they pass such a thing as this, for
religion in this country is simply, believe me,
a matter of policy.” Indeed, religion in the
sixteenth century was not only in England, but
elsewhere, “merely a matter of policy,” a fact
which may explain why Lady Katherine Grey,
who was a good Catholic under Mary, had become
an equally good Protestant under Elizabeth.
After the arrival of Quadra and the departure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the count, and finally, of the Countess of Feria, it
is not probable that Katherine ever came again
into immediate contact with the Spanish Embassy,
although Quadra kept a close watch upon her
movements and was well informed as to what
was happening with respect to her connection
with the succession. Quadra evidently thought
that the people might yet favour Lady Katherine
over Elizabeth, who in the first year of his
embassy he believed to be more unpopular than
she really was. He seemed disgusted at the
queen’s levity and indecision: “It is ruining
her popularity,” he says; “she is in danger of
losing her Crown.” One day she tells him she
will never marry any one, and the next she
asks him if he thinks there would be much
opposition if she married one of her servants
[meaning Dudley], as the duchesses of Somerset
and Suffolk had done. Knowing well what she
meant by this, and remembering that Dudley’s
wife was living, he made no direct answer&mdash;he
could not give her any advice; but it was evident
that the only man she would ever marry was
Robert Dudley. Until he was free, she would
remain free. Presently a fresh rumour was started
concerning Dudley’s neglected wife, Amy Robsart,
now residing, separated from her husband,
at Cumnor Hall, near Oxford, a fair old mansion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
still in existence, which in those days was
rented from the heirs of George Owen, physician to
Henry VIII, by a certain Mr. Anthony Forster.
In November 1559, Quadra wrote to the king
that there is “a rumour in London to the effect
that Robert Dudley thinks of poisoning his wife.”
So at least he has been told by “a person who is
in the habit of giving him veracious news.”
“Certainly,” he adds, “all the queen has done
with us, and will do with the rest in the matter of
her marriage, is only keeping the Lord Robert’s
enemies and the country engaged with words,
until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated.”
The matter had become so serious
that Lady Sidney, Dudley’s sister Mary, who had
been in the habit of visiting Quadra, “thought
it best to abstain from doing so.” Sinister rumours
were, therefore, circulating as early as November
1559, concerning the relations between the queen
and Robert Dudley, and his intention of getting
rid of his wife, by foul means, if necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday, the 8th September of the following
year (1560), Lady Dudley (Amy Robsart) fell
down a back staircase at Cumnor Hall, and was
found dead at the bottom. The following day,
a messenger was sent to Dudley, who was in
attendance on the queen at Windsor, informing
him that his wife had been killed by falling
downstairs, whilst all the servants were absent
from the house at Abingdon Fair. Dudley, who
manifested neither surprise nor much concern,
stated that he did not believe his wife’s death
had been the result of accident, but was an act
of premeditated violence, and added that he feared
he would be implicated in the matter. He immediately
sent the news of the Lady Dudley’s death
to her relations, and invited them to be present
at the coroner’s inquest, which was held at Cumnor
a few days later. Early in September, Quadra,
in a letter to the Duchess of Parma, informed
her that it was rumoured in London that the
Lord Robert was “thinking of killing his wife,
although she was quite well (and would take good
care they did not poison her).” “The next day,”
which would be about the 9th of September, the
queen returning from hunting, meeting him, said
that my Lord Robert’s wife was dead, or nearly
so, and asked him not to say anything about
it. “Certainly,” he continues, “this business
is most shameful and scandalous.” Cecil also,
earlier in the year, had told him that he thought
and believed that Robert Dudley was planning
the murder of his wife. Elizabeth must have
been informed of the unfortunate Amy’s death
almost as soon as Dudley himself, for in the
same letter, dated September 11, Quadra adds a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
postscript: “Since writing the above the queen
has published the news of the death of Robert’s
wife, and has said to me, in Italian, ‘She broke
her neck. She must have fallen downstairs.’”</p>

<p>It is difficult, after reading the above extracts
from the Spanish Papers, not to feel fairly certain
that, notwithstanding Robert Dudley’s persistent
declarations of innocence, he was guilty; and that
Amy Robsart was foully murdered by his orders,
and with Elizabeth’s knowledge and consent. If this
be the case, the “Wizard of the North,” Sir Walter
Scott, was, in the main, right, and his explanation
of the mystery of Cumnor Hall fairly correct.
It was generally believed in London that Dudley
had pre-arranged the murder of his wife, with the
intention of marrying the queen as soon as possible.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
Cecil evidently believed this version of
the story, and, greatly disgusted thereat, turned
his attention in the direction of Lady Katherine.
The supporters of the Earl of Huntingdon, the
representative of the house of Pole, availing
themselves of the queen’s unpopularity, now
began agitating in his favour, and Quadra informed
the King of Spain that he had just heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
that “they are forming an important plan for
the maintenance of their heresies, namely, to
make the Earl of Huntingdon king, in case the
queen should die without issue.” He added
that Cecil had told him that the succession
belonged of right to the earl, because he was
descended from the House of York. Huntingdon,
however, was not really a very formidable
claimant, for although married, he had no children.
Quadra’s letter is dated the 15th of October, and
contains, moreover, the following curious reference
to Lady Katherine: “They fear here that if the
Queen were to die, Your Majesty [the King of
Spain] would get the Kingdom into your family
by means of the Lady Katherine. Cecil has
sounded me on the subject, saying it would be
well if a marriage should take place between her
and one of Your Majesty’s relations ... [<i>Here
there is a piece torn out of the letter</i>]....
She [Lady Katherine] should succeed by virtue
of the will of King Henry. He [Quadra] asked
Cecil if he thought the Queen would declare her
[Lady Katherine] heiress to the Crown; whereupon
Cecil answered, ‘Certainly not, because as
the saying is, the English run after the heir to
the Crown more than after the present wearer
of it.’” In all probability, the relative alluded
to was the Archduke Ferdinand; or may be, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Infante Don Carlos, whose health, however, was
very precarious, so that he, on the other hand,
may have been at this time already out of the
running. Certainly the Archduke was considered
by Quadra as a suitable candidate for Lady Katherine’s
hand, and it was hoped that if such a marriage
could be arranged, Lady Katherine might eventually
ascend the Throne, with Ferdinand as her
consort, and England would thus be brought again
under Spanish influence, if not actually annexed to
that country. With such high interests at stake,
therefore, Quadra had already been for some
time extremely anxious to marry the Archduke
either to Elizabeth or, failing her, to Lady Katherine;
and hence he wrote to the Spanish king, in
November 1559, in the following terms: “This
hatred of the Lord Robert will continue, as the
Duke [of Norfolk] and the rest of them cannot
put up with his being King. I am of opinion
that if the Archduke [Ferdinand] comes and
makes the acquaintance and obtains the goodwill
of these people, even if this marriage&mdash;of which
I have now no hope except by force&mdash;should fall
through, and any disaster were to befall the
Queen, such as may be feared from her bad
government, the Archduke might be summoned
to marry Lady Katherine, to whom the Kingdom
falls if this woman dies. If the Archduke sees
her [Katherine] he should so bear himself that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
she should understand this design, which in my
opinion may be beneficial and even necessary.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately for this scheme, the Archduke
never saw Lady Katherine, and the proposed
match fell through. Elizabeth found out this
intrigue, and resented it, and it was one of the
many reasons for her hatred of Katherine, who,
however, was probably totally unaware of the
numerous plots which were rife concerning
her position as Elizabeth’s heiress; but Hertford,
never very courageous, was growing alarmed.
He knew that the queen, who at one time had
called Lady Katherine her “daughter,” now
expressed her contempt for her, and also kept
her as far removed from her person as possible,
“frowning upon her whenever they passed
each other.” He therefore despaired of ever
obtaining Elizabeth’s consent to their marriage;
and was, moreover, reminded by Cecil (who
one day questioned him very sharply about the
matter of his courtship) of the existence of a
law passed by Henry VIII’s Privy Council and
ratified by Parliament, at the time the Lady
Margaret Douglas, the king’s niece, married her
first husband, Lord Thomas Howard, without
the royal consent, to wit, inflicting the severest
punishment&mdash;imprisonment for life and a fine so
enormous as to absorb an earl’s income&mdash;upon
any man who should marry a kinswoman of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
crown without the king’s leave. The details
of this interview, between the earl and “Mr.
Sekrettory,” came out during the subsequent
examination of Hertford touching the marriage.
Cecil, who was probably actuated much more by
political motives than by any personal desire to
save Hertford from the fate which awaited him
if he married Lady Katherine, came upon the
young man one day, and asked him point-blank,
whether there was not “good-will” between
him and the lady in question. “There
is no such thing,” was Hertford’s prompt but
untruthful reply. When on his trial, the earl,
tormented by scruples, stated publicly that “he
desired it to be noted that there <i>was no</i> truth
in his reply to Mr. Secretary Cecil.” A little
later on&mdash;but, it seems, after the marriage had
actually taken place&mdash;Cecil tried to find out from
Katherine herself how matters stood. Always
haunted by the idea that one day she might succeed
Elizabeth as queen, he was anxious to try
to prevent a marriage which, he wisely foresaw,
would but injure her cause yet further in the
queen’s eyes. Cecil, a cunning diplomat, commenced
by questioning Katherine over some
extraneous matter concerning her property, but
eventually insinuated a few words, warning her
“of her too great familiarity with the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Hertford”; and considerately added, that he
“would not make the Queen’s Majesty privy
thereto.” Katherine, later on, said that the warning,
if it had been given before the marriage,
might have been heeded. What reply she made
at the time is not on record. Prompted by
Cecil, the Marquis of Northampton and the
“Fair Geraldine” also approached the princess
on the subject, advising her “to beware of the
company and familiarity of the said earl,” of
whom, one fancies, none of these worthy interferes
had a very high opinion. Their advice,
however, if indeed it did not really come too
late, was disregarded.</p>

<p>Love, like Justice, is reputed blind; and between
All Hallows and Christmas, 1560, a year after the
death of the Lady Frances, Hertford solemnly
pledged his troth to Katherine and presented her
with a plain gold ring, which opened with a secret
spring in several linked compartments, on each
of which he had engraved different Latin distichs
of his own composition. They ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pplong p1">As circles five, by art compressed, show but one ring to sight,</p>
<p class="pplong">So trust uniteth faithful minds, with knot of secret might,</p>
<p class="pplong">Whose force to break (but greedy Death) no wight possesseth power,</p>
<p class="pplong">As time and sequels well shall prove. My ring can say no more.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">And so, in the presence of Lady Jane Seymour
only, and in that lady’s chamber in Westminster
Palace, the two lovers were formally betrothed,
with, however, “no ceremonies,” as he afterwards
admitted, beyond kissing and embracing
each other and joining their hands together,
before his sister, the Lady Jane Seymour. A
little later in December, whilst the Lady Jane
Seymour was in her private sitting-room, a large
apartment which no one was allowed to enter
without her leave, she received “a letter” from her
brother, saying he was very ill, “love-sick,” and
must see the Lady Katherine at once: would she
receive him in her chamber, as he wished to open his
heart to her? Whereupon the Lady Jane sent one
of the little maids to him, saying that he was to
follow her. Half-an-hour later, the two lovers
were reunited by Lady Jane’s fireside. Poor
Lady Katherine, apparently ignorant of the probable
results of her foolish act, after embracing
her lover many times, said: “Weighing your long
suit and great good-will towards me, I am well
content, be the consequences what they may,
to marry you the next time the Queen’s Highness
shall go abroad and leave the Lady Jane alone
with me.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c165" id="c165">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="pch">THE CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> five or six days after the betrothal of Lady
Katherine to the Earl of Hertford, Queen Elizabeth
elected to go with her train to Greenwich on a
hunting expedition; and, summoning her ladies and
maids, ordered them to make immediate preparations
to follow her. Lady Katherine excused
herself on the plea that she was sore afflicted with
toothache, and as an evidence of the fact, exhibited
her swollen face, tied up in a kerchief: whilst Lady
Jane Seymour declared that she could “not go
a-hunting, for she was sick with a bad headache.”
The unsuspecting queen accepted these excuses
and left the girls to their own devices. Scarcely
had Her Majesty and her train left Westminster
Palace, than the young ladies stole out and
repaired to the Earl of Hertford’s house in Cannon
Row, Westminster. His Lordship had previously
despatched all his servants on various errands;
some he sent into the city, others to the country,
but his confidential valet was told to wait for him
at a goldsmith’s shop in Fleet Street. Powell,
the cook, however, afterwards deposed before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the council that he had seen the Lady Katherine
and the Lady Jane steal out of the water-gate
stairs, and enter the earl’s chamber, to reach
which they had to pass the kitchen door. In the
earl’s bedroom was a priest, who performed
the marriage service, Lady Jane Seymour being
the only witness. The earl gave his bride a wedding
ring, apparently the one already mentioned.
Hertford afterwards asserted that the clergyman
was brought to the house by Lady Jane, and described
him as a fair-complexioned man of middle
stature, with an auburn beard; he had no surplice,
but wore a garb resembling that of the foreign
Reformers who returned to England after Queen
Mary’s death&mdash;a long furred black cloth gown,
with a turn-down collar of white linen. Neither
the earl nor Katherine seem to have known this
reverend worthy’s name; but Lady Jane paid him
a fee of ten pounds, out of the pocket money which
her brother gave her for her clothes&mdash;he himself
seems to have been short of cash at the time. A
sort of informal wedding repast had been prepared
in the earl’s chamber, but the Lady Katherine,
we learn, was too much unnerved to eat or drink.
About two hours after the brief ceremony was over,
the earl escorted the young ladies down the stairs
and “kissed Lady Katherine good-bye.” The
tide had risen during the interval, and the maids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of honour were obliged to take boat back to the
palace, the pathway by which they had come
being under water. They must have reached
Westminster very early&mdash;the wedding took place
in the morning<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>&mdash;for they dined at noon as usual
at the table of the comptroller of the household.
Nobody seems to have noticed their absence, nor,
except the cook, to have paid attention to their
movements, and for a time the queen remained in
ignorance of the event. But Katherine had the
temerity, at least so Hertford afterwards alleged,
to wear the coif known as a “froze-paste,” under
her hood: it may be remarked here that her sister,
Lady Jane Grey, had worn a similar coif&mdash;not
unlike a nun’s&mdash;at her execution. This close-fitting
cap, which entirely concealed the hair, was
worn by all married women, even if young, and is
said to have been one of the reasons why Elizabeth
refused to marry. She wished her subjects
always to enjoy the privilege of admiring her
magnificent hair. Under the circumstances, Lady
Katherine would have been wiser to have disregarded
this traditional custom.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The course of true love did not flow smoothly
for long, for on March 20, 1561, the learned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
though youthful, Lady Jane Seymour died suddenly
in her apartment at Westminster Palace.
Elizabeth, who was much attached to her, and
unaware of her share in Lady Katherine’s affairs,
ordered a state funeral of great splendour, and
six days after her death, Lady Jane was buried in
St. Edmund’s Chapel, Westminster Abbey, where
her monument is still to be seen, with an inscription
to the effect that it was erected by “her dear
brother,” the Earl of Hertford. All the queen’s
ladies attended the funeral, among them being the
Ladies Katherine and Mary Grey. Machyn gives
a quaint account of what he calls the funeral of
“my lade Jane Semer, the wyche was one of the
Quen’s mayds and in grett favor.” Her death
must have deeply grieved Lady Katherine, who
was not only very fond of Lady Jane, but had
found in her a sympathetic confidante.</p>

<p>Throughout the year 1561, the young couple
exchanged regular, though secret, visits either at
Westminster Palace or at Cannon Row. Lady
Katherine, in her examination, said that, from
the time of the marriage onwards to the death of
Lady Jane Seymour, “considering herself as the
earl’s wife, in her own heart, she was often in his
company at sundry times by means of Lady Jane
Seymour and a woman, her own maid, Mrs. Leigh,
who was now gone from her. This woman never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
was bade to do it, but she would, of herself, if she
saw my Lord and her [Katherine] whisper together,
go out of the way.” Indeed, the discretion of
Hertford and his wife was so great that no one
appears to have realized the truth for a considerable
time after the clandestine wedding had
taken place, although, as already observed, Cecil
and some of Katherine’s friends certainly suspected
that a love intrigue was afoot.</p>

<p>About April 1561, the queen&mdash;possibly on the
advice of Cecil, who, suspecting something untoward,
wanted him out of the way&mdash;ordered
Hertford to accompany Mr. Thomas Cecil, son
of the above-named statesman, into France,
where the young gentlemen were to take up
certain legal studies. The Duchess of Somerset,
evidently in total ignorance of what had occurred,
addressed a letter to Cecil, on April 19, 1561,
in which she says she is content to submit to her
son’s going abroad; but adds: “I would wish him
matched at home in some noble house to the
Queen’s liking.” Whether there had been some
disagreement between the mother and son it is
now impossible to say, but the Duchess goes on
to express her sorrow for “hys wylfulness,” and
somewhat spitefully begs Cecil “not to spare him,
but to overrule him.” Hertford was apparently
not at all distressed by this sudden separation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
his bride, from whom he seems to have taken leave
at Greenwich, where the court was then staying.
A few months later, the studious Mr. Cecil
writes complaining that his “studies and meditations”
are considerably disturbed and interrupted
by “the gaieties and jaunts” organized by his
youthful monitor, the earl.</p>

<p>Whilst her husband was thus gaily disporting
himself in the French capital, Lady Katherine
was left alone, to realize that soon she would no
longer be able to conceal her condition. So great
was her terror when she became certain of this,
that she mislaid the deed of jointure assigning her
£1000, which her husband had made in her favour
before he left England; and in her terror, the
forlorn little woman, on receiving orders to attend
the queen during Her Majesty’s progress through
Suffolk, rushed, one Sunday afternoon late in July
or in August, to her old friend Mistress Saintlow,
and confessed, with bitter tears, that in a few weeks
she was sure to become a mother; “but,” added
she, “I am an honest woman and am married to
Lord Hertford.” The recipient of this astonishing
information, instead of offering consolation, burst
into an hysterical rage, and violently upbraided
the wretched Katherine for selecting her as the
confidante of her folly. How the poor girl spent
the rest of that day we know not, but she must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
have worked herself into a perfect frenzy, for
towards midnight she suddenly appeared, in her
night-gown, at the bedside of her all-powerful
brother-in-law, Lord Robert Dudley, who was
fast asleep. His unexpected visitor’s lamentations
soon roused him, and, to his amazement, he beheld
her kneeling by his bed, shaking with sobs, and “in
a most awesome state of mind.” With streaming
eyes she confessed everything, and besought him
to induce the queen to be merciful to her. She
reminded him that he was the brother of young
Guildford Dudley, the husband of her unhappy
sister, Lady Jane, and entreated him, in the name
of this slaughtered brother, whom he had fondly
loved, to go to the queen and obtain her pardon.
The nocturnal visit placed Lord Robert in a very
difficult position, for if the dispatches of La Motte,
Fénelon and Quadra are reliable, Elizabeth invariably
slept, as already said, in a chamber adjacent
to his, and moreover communicating with
it. Dudley was frightened out of his wits, lest
the “Lioness of England” should suddenly rush
in, to pounce upon the weeping Katherine in her
night-gear. We are not told how he managed
to rid himself of the distracted suppliant, but
we do know that on the following morning he
told Elizabeth the whole story, whereupon that
royal virago burst into a whirlwind of rage, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
immediate result of which was that the Lady Katherine
was sent to the Tower that afternoon, and
lodged in the part of it known as the Belfry. Cecil
communicated Lady Katherine Grey’s situation to
Archbishop Parker, in a letter dated August 12,
1561, in the following terms: “She is committed
to the Tower, and he sent for [to come]
home. She <i>says</i> she is married.” He doubted,
or pretended to doubt, that a marriage had really
taken place. Cecil, who was essentially self-seeking,
had, in the days of Elizabeth’s greatest unpopularity,
espoused her rival’s cause, and now,
according to Quadra, he was anxious, at any cost, to
avoid being implicated in unpleasant consequences.
“What I understand by it all, is,” remarks the
Spanish ambassador, “that Lady Katherine’s
marriage ... [was] arranged a year ago, after the
death of Robert’s wife, and that Cecil (who was
then in great disgrace with the Queen and at
enmity with Robert) was at the bottom of it, in
the fear that, in accord with common belief, the
Queen would marry Robert and restore religion
to obtain Your Majesty’s favour. Since Cecil has
returned to the good graces of the Queen, and has
satisfied himself that there will be no change of
religion, he has gradually and cautiously separated
himself from these negotiations, and is now endeavouring
to hush up and amend the past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>”
Nevertheless, Cecil did not entirely abandon
Lady Katherine. The news of the marriage must,
however, have come as rather a blow to Philip
of Spain, since it scattered his own schemes for
Katherine’s bestowal; whilst the inevitable imprisonment
which followed, put her effectually
out of his reach. From this time forth, Spanish
interest in Katherine was considerably diminished.</p>

<p>Immediately after the queen was made aware of
the marriage, the news was conveyed to Hertford’s
mother, the old Duchess of Somerset, who forthwith,
on August 22, wrote a monstrous letter
to Cecil, casting all the blame of the affair on
poor Katherine, and beseeching him to believe
that she [the duchess] had no hand in the matter,
declaring that “neither for child nor friend”
would she willingly neglect the duty of a faithful
subject. Hence she begs “good Master Secretary”
to “stand her friend, that the wildness of mine
unruly child do not minish [<i>sic</i>] Her Majesty’s
favour towards me.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But Her Majesty’s anger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
knew no bounds, and even poor Lady Saintlow
was committed to the Tower, for the fell crime of
having been Katherine’s involuntary confidante!
A letter in Her Majesty’s own hand commanded
Sir Edward Warner, Lieutenant of the Tower, to
“examine the Lady Katherine, very straitly, how
many hath been privy to the love between her and
the Earl of Hertford from the beginning; and let
her understand that she shall have no manner of
favour except she will show the truth&mdash;not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
what ladies and gentlewomen were thereto privy,
but also what lords and gentlewomen of this
court; for it doth now appear that sundry personages
have dealt therein. When that shall
appear more manifestly it shall increase our
indignation against her, if she now forbears to
utter it.” Apparently the queen, aware of
the existence of the Spanish plot, hoped that, if
one or other of the “sundry personages” was
intimidated, they would reveal the whole truth.
Very likely, too, she had a shrewd idea that
Cecil was involved. Katherine was, however,
obstinate&mdash;nothing would make her confess; so
that on August 22, Warner informed the queen
by letter that he had questioned Lady Katherine
as to “the love practices between her and the
earl” and that “she will confess nothing.”</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, Sir Edward received orders
to furnish the Lady Katherine’s apartment with
some of the cast-off splendour which lingered
in the forsaken state apartments of the Tower.
This furniture had very likely been used by the
Lady Jane during the “nine-days’ reign,” or
even by Elizabeth herself when a prisoner;
and though described as “much worn, torn, and
defaced”&mdash;so little value is set on historical
objects in the days to which they belong&mdash;would
doubtless now fetch its weight in gold at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Christie’s. The unkindly office of critic of these
relics of vanished grandeur assigned for the Lady
Katherine’s use, was later on discharged by Sir
Edward Warner, whose scathing comments on
the “owld” stools and cushions are, as we shall
see, most quaint and amusing. It may have been
as well that the furniture of the Lady Katherine’s
prison-dwelling was not in its primal magnificence,
for before she had been two days in the Tower,
her very extensive collection of parrots, monkeys,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
and lap-dogs followed her from Westminster&mdash;and
a nice smell and a pretty mess they must have
made! However, the creatures were company of
a kind, and no doubt heartily welcome to the
captive.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the miserable bridegroom, recalled&mdash;apparently
without warning of the fate which
awaited him&mdash;from Paris, had arrived at Dover,
and was promptly lodged in “Her Majesty’s
house”&mdash;i.e. the castle. Whilst he was at breakfast
with a certain Mr. Thomas Sackville and a
Mr. Strange, Mr. Crispe, the “captain” of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
castle, entered, and showed Hertford his commission
for the latter’s arrest. This read, the
“captain” formally arrested the young earl, who
was deprived of his servants and of the society of
his friends, taken up to London, and immediately
lodged in the Tower (September 5). On the
following day he was ordered to appear before
the Marquis of Winchester, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Grindal Bishop of London, Sir
William Petre, and a host of divines and seculars,
and ordered to answer their questions regarding
what they were pleased to call “his infamous
proceedings with the Lady Katherine Grey.”
Hertford behaved like a gentleman, and all the
brow-beating and hectoring of his inquisitors
failed to intimidate him. He swore he had been
lawfully married, by a priest fetched by his sister,
and described him in the terms already quoted.
Search was forthwith made for this priest, whom
people rightly imagined to be a Roman Catholic,
but it was not until forty-six years later, in the
reign of James I, that he was discovered, and the
validity of the marriage proved. The report that
he was a Catholic priest was then found to be
correct; and the fact tends to prove that Lady
Katherine was still a Catholic, with whom marriage
is a Sacrament. The officiating clergyman being
undiscoverable, Lady Jane Seymour, the principal
witness of the wedding, lately dead, and the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
tangible proofs of the ceremony the bridegroom’s
own word and the wedding-ring, the legitimacy of
the expected infant might easily have been then
and there invalidated. But this course was not
followed. It was deemed bad policy “to charge
a princess of the blood with harlotry.”</p>

<p>The Lady Katherine was next examined. She
shed floods of tears throughout the whole proceeding;
and confirmed everything her husband
had said. Exhibiting the curious five-pieced ring
already mentioned, she added that before Lady
Jane Seymour’s death she had told her she feared
she was <i>enceinte</i>, and that she (Lady Jane) and Hertford
had suggested an appeal to the queen’s mercy.
She stated that some days before he left for France,
she told her husband she thought she was
about to become a mother, and that he replied, if
this was indeed the case, he would return shortly
to her. She admitted she had written to him
during his absence, but had not received any
answer to her letters; though, to her distress, he
had sent various “tokens” to other ladies about
the queen&mdash;which indicates a certain lack, on the
earl’s part, of enthusiasm for his young bride,
quite in accordance, however, with the festive
existence he had been leading in Paris. She also
mentioned the loss of the deed of settlement. She
had written her husband a letter about this matter,
to inform him of her condition, and had entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
it to a man named Glynne, lately a servant in the
employ of Lady Jane Seymour, and now apparently
used as a spy by the queen. In this letter
she advised her husband to return at once, and
confess the whole affair. It only reached him
one month before his official recall. Glynne
lyingly pretended to the earl that his business
in Paris was to find a relative of his who had
“stolen his master’s money.” He had remained
a considerable time in Paris, and when asked by
the earl why he did so, gave an evasive answer.
Hertford admitted the receipt of the letter brought
by Glynne; and said he had sent his wife several
letters from France, incidentally giving us a
curious insight into the postal arrangements of
the period. He despatched one note from Rouen
by “the common <i>letter-bag</i> which went by packet.”
From this it may be inferred that even in those
days, some sort of regular postal service existed
between this country and the Continent. Whether
this service was hopelessly inefficient, or whether
Hertford was not telling the truth when he said
he had written Lady Katherine several letters, we
are not able to affirm, but she swore, as we have
said, that she never received a single line, although
admitting that Lord Henry Seymour, Hertford’s
brother, when she was at Havering in Essex, gave
her a pair of bracelets from the earl. Hertford
deposed that he entrusted one of his epistles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Monsieur “Jehan Renate, a merchant who lived
on the bridge at Paris,” to whom he gave particular
instructions “to deliver his letter into the
very hands of Lady Katherine”; M. Renate,
however, seems to have been unable to fulfil his
mission, for she never even received this note.
Lord Henry Seymour was also called, and deposed
that he had carried presents from his brother to
Katherine, even before the former went abroad;
but though he thought some of these were rings,
he denied handing Lady Katherine any letters
from Hertford, either before or during his brother’s
trip to the Continent. “Some of the earl’s
letters,” he went on to say, “came by the common
post, and some by Frannces the Post.” He also
swore he knew nothing of the marriage, though it
would appear from the above that he was aware
of the existence of the missing correspondence.
Elizabeth could possibly have thrown considerable
light on the subject and even have produced the
letters, had it suited her purpose so to do&mdash;for
without doubt they were in her possession.</p>

<p class="pch">LADY KATHERINE AND HER HUSBAND IN
THE TOWER</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the inquiry, which dragged on for some
weeks, had come to a close, Lady Katherine, on
September 21, 1561, was delivered in the Tower
of a male child, whose birth Machyn records in a
delightfully complicated phrase: “The xxj day
of September was browth [brought] to bed of a
sune my lade Katheryn Gray, the dowther of the
Duke that was heded on the Towre hylle, and ys
brodur Lord Thomas Gray the sam tyme.” Five
days later the boy was baptized in the church of
St. Peter ad Vincula within the Tower, his father
declaring he was indeed his son and heir, and
giving him the name of Edward. The witnesses
of this christening must have stood on the flagstones
covering the remains of no less than six
of this infant’s immediate forbears, all of whom
had lately perished by the axe.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> According to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Henry VIII’s will, the unconscious babe, thus
baptized above the remains of his slaughtered
relatives, was the legitimate heir to the English
Throne; and, as such, in after years, added
yet another complication to the tangle of the
succession.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the young mother’s health broke
down, and for some months she had to keep her
bed, in her room in the Belfry or Bell Tower. In
spite of her suffering condition, Elizabeth’s relentless
persecution continued. She put spies about the
Tower, who informed her of any attempt at communication
between the two young prisoners:
and the “Virgin Queen” was violently excited
on learning that the earl had been inquiring
after his wife’s health, through a third person
(a Tower official), and that he had on one occasion
actually sent her a “posy.” According to Lady
Katherine’s statement (for she was interrogated
even about this simple incident), being “a close
prisoner in the Tower,” she never saw the person
who brought her messages and “posies” from the
earl.</p>

<p>In May 1562, Sir Edward Warner received orders
to conduct the two prisoners before the Archbishop
of Canterbury at Lambeth, to be further examined
as to what Elizabeth was pleased to describe in
the warrant as “the infamose conversation and
pretended marriage betwixt the Lady Katherine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Grey and the Earl of Hertford.” Despite the
ecclesiastical nature of this court, it would seem
that the prisoners were not taken to Lambeth,
but that whatever trial ever took place occurred
in the Tower. On May 12, 1562, the commission,
composed, it may be, of the officers who had examined
Hertford on his first entering the Tower,
passed sentence, at the Bishop of London’s palace
near to St. Paul’s Cathedral, to the effect that
“there had been no marriage between the Earl
of Hertford and the Lady Katherine Grey.” It
is probable that neither Hertford nor Lady Katherine
was present during this adjudication.</p>

<p>Five months later, in October 1562, Lady
Katherine, still confined in the Belfry of the
Tower, came nearer being placed on the Throne
than at any time in her life. On the 10th of that
month, Queen Elizabeth went with her train to
Hampton Court, and there fell seriously ill.
After several days of high fever, and a fit of syncope
lasting two hours, during which her life was
despaired of, Her Majesty was found to be suffering
from small-pox, aggravated by a bad chill.
Quadra’s dispatches, written at this time, show
how precarious was her condition. “Last night,”
he writes, in a letter dated the 17th October, “the
palace people were all mourning for her as if she
were already dead ... She was all but gone.”
Naturally, the chief effect of the queen’s sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
illness was to raise the hopes of the various pretenders
to her succession and of those who, from
interest or conviction, supported them. There was
such diversity of opinion, however, even amongst
the members of the privy council,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> as to who was
the rightful or most suitable future sovereign, that
it is not improbable, that had the queen died at this
juncture, England, between the ambitions of one
party and of another, would have been plunged
into a civil war, since some of the pretenders
seem to have been prepared to assert their rights
by an appeal to arms; “Lord Robert [Dudley],”
says the Spanish Ambassador, “has a large armed
force under his control, and will probably pronounce
for his brother-in-law, the Earl of Huntingdon.”
Lady Katherine Grey’s partisans did not
miss this opportunity to agitate in her favour;
and in the event of the queen’s death, a determined
attempt would undoubtedly have been made to
seat her on the Throne of her oppressor. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
news of Elizabeth’s precarious condition produced
a profound feeling of anxiety in the political
world both at home and abroad; and Quadra
writes to King Philip, that “if her improvement
had not come soon, some hidden thoughts would
have become manifest. The council discussed
the succession twice, and I am told there were
three different opinions. Some wished King
Henry’s will to be followed and Lady Katherine
declared heiress. Others, who found flaws in the
will, were in favour of the Earl of Huntingdon.
Lord Robert, the Earl of Bedford, the Earl of
Pembroke, and the Duke of Norfolk ... were in
favour of this.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> A few members of the council
wished the others not to be in such “a furious
hurry,” and advised them to wait until the claims
of the various pretenders had been examined
by “the greatest jurists in the country”; a
suggestion regarded, however, as simply an expedient,
to give the King of Spain time to place
a Catholic Sovereign on the English Throne.
Fortunately for England, Elizabeth made a rapid
recovery. To the consternation of the council her
first act, after the prolonged syncope into which she
had fallen, was to ask the said council to appoint
the Lord Robert Dudley protector of the realm
during her convalescence, at an income of £20,000.
“Everything she asked was promised,” Quadra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
adds, “but will not be fulfilled.” And he proved
a true prophet!</p>

<p>In November 1562 the question of the succession
was again discussed, at a meeting attended
by the Duke of Norfolk and others, which was
held in the Earl of Arundel’s house. The object
of this gathering seems to have been to
endorse Lady Katherine’s pretensions, now greatly
favoured by Norfolk, who in the course of the
preceding month, had developed a shadowy notion
that, at some future time, one of his daughters (as
yet mere infants) “might marry the Countess of
Hertford’s lately born son.” The council discussed
these grave matters all one evening and till two
o’clock the next morning, when they parted,
unanimously in favour of Lady Katherine’s right
to the Throne after the queen’s death. When
Elizabeth heard of the affair, she actually
“wept for rage,” and summoning Arundel, upbraided
him in no measured terms for allowing
such a meeting to take place under his roof. The
earl, in an off-hand manner, told the queen that
“if she wanted to govern the country by passion,
he could assure her the nobles would not allow
her to do so”; whereupon Her Majesty, abashed,
hastily changed the subject.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1562-63, the partisans of
Lady Katherine seem to have directed their
attention to Hertford, and at one time, led by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Cecil, seriously proposed setting him up as a
claimant to the Throne,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> <i>faute de míeux</i>. Needless
to say, the earl, except for his position as Lady
Katherine’s husband, had no more to do with the
succession than any other nobleman. Cecil, however,
was still anxious to aid Lady Katherine and
her husband, and had it depended on him, doubtless
they would have been forthwith set at
liberty. He was hostile to Lord Robert Dudley,
and moreover jealous of his influence; and being
out of favour with the queen in consequence,
was quite prepared to aid her rival. Not improbably,
the queen’s persistent refusal to be
merciful to her captives, was to some extent
caused by a desire to annoy and embarrass her
chief secretary. Elizabeth’s health being still
unsatisfactory, early in 1563, the question of
the succession was again brought before Parliament,
and Cecil, as a solution to the difficulty,
proposed that a committee should be formed of
twenty-four members of the privy council, who,
in the event of the queen’s death, would conduct
the affairs of the nation for the first three weeks
after the sovereign’s demise, until a successor
had been approved of by them. The gentlemen
nominated for this high office, however, one
and all begged to be excused, pleading that
they felt safer on their country estates than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
if they were all gathered together in London:
though, at the same time, they refused to appoint
others to take their places on this commission.
The fact is, it was well known that Cecil had
determined to try to include amongst these
councillors as many of the male claimants to the
Throne or their chief supporters as he conveniently
could; his real object being, it was suspected, to
attempt, when the queen died, a <i>coup d’état</i>
similar to that which followed on the death of
Edward VI. Hertford and Lady Katherine would,
it was feared, be released; and, supported by the
Londoners&mdash;“the City being so much in favour
of the Earl of Hertford on the ground of religion,”
according to Quadra&mdash;the Lady Katherine would
be crowned queen, as her sister Jane had been.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Meanwhile, as many of the other claimants and
their partisans as could be laid hands on, especially
such of them as the wily Cecil had got together
in London on the pretext of the above-mentioned
committee, would be thrust into prison, and,
possibly, executed. The opposition being too
strong, the scheme was forthwith dropped, and
the vexed question of the succession was again
left in abeyance for a few months.</p>

<p>Whilst her name was thus being bandied about
by various political factions, Lady Katherine
remained a peaceful and probably fairly contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
prisoner in the Tower. The old Italian proverb,
that neither walls nor waters can separate lovers,
once more proved true, when, on February 10,
1563, notwithstanding Elizabeth’s vigilance, and
the strict orders issued to Sir Edward Warner, the
Lady Katherine became the mother of a second
boy, who was baptized in St. Peter’s in the Tower,
two warders acting as godfathers. He received
the name of Thomas, after his great-uncle, the
lord high admiral. Elizabeth when she heard of
this second child’s birth, raged less like Medea
than one of her dragons, and vented her spleen
on the young earl, who was haled before Star
Chamber to justify himself of the further
“offence” of having visited his wife in prison.
Hertford, attacked in the coarsest terms,
replied like a man, that “being lawfully married
to the Lady Katherine Grey, who hath borne
me a fair son during the time of our imprisonment
in the Tower, and finding her prison door
unbarred, I came in to comfort her in her sadness,
of which I cannot repent.” The lieutenant,
Warner, who was likewise examined, gave a different
account of the meeting, since he admitted
without hesitation that he had allowed the earl
and countess “to visit one another once on being
over persuaded, and afterwards thought it was of
no use keeping them apart.” Nevertheless, the
earl was heavily fined&mdash;15,000 marks in all;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
5000 for “seducing a virgin of the blood royal”;
5000 for breaking prison&mdash;i.e. when he left his
own apartments to visit Lady Katherine; and
5000 for the birth of the second child, described by
the Chamber as “a bastard.” The earl not having
sufficient money to pay this sum off-hand, his
estates were, as usual in such cases, confiscated
instead.</p>

<p>Star Chamber was certainly influenced, in
passing this sentence, by one of its most servile
members, Sir John Mason,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> with whom Hertford
was eventually condemned to live for a time. On
January 28, 1562 (a year before the date of the
birth of the second child), this worthy, in a letter
to Secretary Cecil, declares:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“There be abroad in the city, and in sundry
other places in the realm, broad speeches of the
case of the Lady Katherine and the Earl of
Hertford. Some of ignorance make such talks
thereof as liketh them, not letting to say [meaning,
‘not scrupling to say’] they be man and wife.
And why should man and wife be lett (‘hindered’]
from coming together? These speeches and
others are very common. And, to tell my foolish
judgment thereof, methinketh it will be no ill
way to call him [Hertford] to the Star Chamber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and there, after a good declaration of the
queen’s proceedings for the trial of the truth
of the supposed marriage, and what was found
adjudged, then to charge him with his presumptuous,
contemptuous, and outrageous behaviour
in using the said Lady Katherine as he hath done,
before the sentence and since. And in the end
to set upon his head a fine of XM [10,000] marks:
if they be made pounds it is little enough. There
is not a more oultreayed youth&mdash;I speak French
for lack of apt English [perhaps the curious word
‘oultreayed’ was Mason’s version of the ‘French’
adjective <i>outré</i>]&mdash;neither one that better liketh
himself, nor that promiseth himself greater things.
He should be made to learn himself [i.e. ‘discipline
himself’] to see his own faults. His imprisonment
fatteneth him, and he hath rather thereby
commodity than hindrance [meaning, ‘He rather
enjoys his imprisonment than otherwise’]. If a
good part of his living (‘income’] might answer
some part of his offence, and the imprisonment
therewithal continue, it would make him to know
what it is to have so arrogantly and contemptuously
offended his prince [i.e. the queen], and
would make him hereafter to know his duty to the
state and to Almighty God. I beseech you pardon
my rude scribbling and my boldness showed in the
same, and to weigh my good meaning in this
matter, and nothing else. And thus Almighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
God have you in His Most blessed keeping, and
assist you alway with His present grace.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Star Chamber therefore not only treated Hertford
in a manner that must have been most pleasing
to the spiteful Sir John Mason, but even exceeded
his suggestion in the matter of the fine. Maybe
Mason had had some quarrel or words with the
earl, that led him to write so bitterly; although
even his mother, the duchess, can have had no
very high opinion of him, since she speaks of his
“wylfulness.” Elizabeth now ordered Sir Edward
Warner, Lieutenant of the Tower, to be arrested
and forthwith confined in that fortress over which
he had lately ruled supreme. He had indeed been
imprisoned there once before, for alleged complicity
in the Wyatt rebellion, and had only been reinstated
as lieutenant at Elizabeth’s accession.
Through the influence of Cecil, his close friend,
Warner contrived to regain his freedom, after
his second imprisonment, in 1563; but he lost his
post, this time for good, and retired into the
country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the House of Commons had been
holding lengthy debates about the troubles of the
two young victims of Elizabeth’s persecution, and
many of the Puritan, or extreme Low Church,
party, who favoured Katherine’s right to the
Throne, were very much inclined to believe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
validity of the marriage, and consequently, in
the legitimacy of the two children. In the
meantime, Elizabeth released Lady Margaret
Lennox, whom she had confined in the Tower
on an obscure charge&mdash;a liberation on which the
Reformers looked askance, for though Margaret
stood nearer the Throne than Katherine, being
a daughter of Henry VIII’s eldest sister, Margaret
Queen of Scots, she, as a Roman Catholic,
was regarded by the Protestants as a danger
to their cause. Her husband, the Earl of
Lennox, had also been imprisoned some months
earlier, but was set free about November
1562. Quadra, in mentioning this fact, states
that it took place “by the favour of the
Earl of Pembroke and Lord Robert [Dudley],
who are much against Lady Katherine.” He
also confirms what we have said above. “I
think,” he adds, “that the liberation of Lennox
has two objects: first, to hinder Lady Katherine
by providing a competitor; and secondly, to
give a little satisfaction to the Catholics, who
are desperate at Lady Margaret’s misery, and
place all their hopes in the Queen of Scots
and the husband she may choose. By giving
them some hope that the succession may fall
to Lady Margaret and her son, they may cool
somewhat towards the Queen of Scots. All this
is convenient for the queen, who wants to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the power to declare her own successor when
she likes.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>In the summer of 1563, the plague broke out in
London with such violence, and made so many
victims within the precincts of the Tower, that
Lady Katherine, greatly alarmed, begged Cecil to
intercede with the queen for her removal from the
infected fortress. Elizabeth at once consented,
signing (August 21, 1563) an order<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> expressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
her “contentation” that the Lady “Catharyne”
should be sent to her uncle, Lord John Grey,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> at
his seat at Pirgo, near Havering-atte-Bower and
Hainault Forest in Essex. This nobleman, be it
said, was not very friendly to his niece. Still&mdash;“any
port in the storm”; and it was certainly
better to go to Pirgo with an unpleasant relation,
than to stay in London with a chance of dying of
the plague. With the Lady Katherine went her
baby son and a goodly number of nurses and attendants.
Hertford, as the warrant shows, was
also removed from the Tower, and sent, with the
eldest child, Edward, to Hanworth, to the house
of the old Duchess of Somerset, his mother.
Shortly after her husband’s execution, this handsome&mdash;but
haughty and ill-tempered dame&mdash;had
married, as already stated, Sergeant Newdigate,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
who was now entrusted with the duty of conducting
Lady Katherine to Pirgo. He led the caravan
which escorted her and her baby, with their
attendants and baggage, from the Tower; and on
their arrival at Pirgo, which was before the end
of August, made himself very disagreeable both to
Lady Katherine and to Lord John.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a little comedy occurred with respect
to the tattered furniture in the Tower of London.
Sir Edward Warner, after his dismissal from the
lieutenancy, had retired to Plumstead, near
Norwich, where he had a country house. As soon
as he heard Katherine had been transferred from
the Tower to Pirgo, he wrote to Cecil, demanding
compensation for furniture and hangings which
he had lent to the imprisoned lady, when under
his care. “Sir,” he writes, “my Lady Katherine
is, as ye know, delivered [from the Tower], and the
stuff that she had&mdash;I would it were seen. It was
delivered to her by the queen’s commandment,
and she hath worn, now two years full, most of it
so torn and tattered with her monks [i.e. monkeys]
and dogs as will serve to small purpose....
Besides,” he continues, “my Lady Katherine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
had one other chamber, furnished with stuff of
mine, the which is all marred also.” He goes on
to suggest that it would not be unreasonable,
considering its dilapidated condition, if he were
granted the furniture allotted to Lady Katherine
out of the royal Wardrobe, as well as his own.
“It was,” he says, “delivered by the queen’s
pleasure.... If I have it not, some of it is fitter
to be given away than to be stored into the Wardrobe
again, and that I justify with my hand. If
he [the Lord Chamberlain] like not that I have the
bed of down, I shall be content to forbear it. I
send you here enclosed the bill of parcels,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
notes in the margent truly written.” He concludes
his appeal&mdash;from “my poor house at Plumsted”&mdash;by
rather ambiguously wishing Cecil “prosperous
felicity, with <i>increase</i> of godliness.” Whether Sir
Edward Warner ever got his coveted goods and
chattels or not we are unable to ascertain. Neither
are we informed whether Katherine conveyed her
“monks,” her dogs, and her other pets to Pirgo;
it is probable enough that she did, for one of her
pet dogs was with her when she died a few years
later.</p>

<p>The journey to Pirgo, notwithstanding that it
was performed in one of Elizabeth’s own travelling
coaches&mdash;a ponderous vehicle, that required four
Flemish cart-horses to drag it along the ill-kept
roads&mdash;must have been very fatiguing for a woman
in Lady Katherine’s delicate condition. Pirgo,
too, though a fine old mansion, dating far back into
Edward III’s time, and surrounded by a moat,
did not present many of the “modern improvements,”
even of those days: it is described as
“very draughty, damp, and cold.” The Lord
John had lately made some alterations, but they
do not seem to have been very important. The
gardens of Pirgo&mdash;and this may have been some
consolation to the prisoner&mdash;were exceedingly
fine; and the park was one of the grandest in
Essex.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c199" id="c199">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p class="pch">LADY KATHERINE AT PIRGO</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prisoner’s life at Pirgo seems to have been
tolerably peaceful and comfortable. Although
her uncle continued to treat her coldly, nevertheless,
before the end of August (1563), the
month in which she reached his house, Lord John
Grey wrote to thank Cecil for obtaining “this
indulgence from the queen for his niece.” She
herself also addressed a similar letter to Cecil
dated the “thred” of September;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> but very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
soon after, she seems to have been overcome by
an attack of profound melancholy, and even the
kindness of her aunt&mdash;this lady was a daughter
of Sir Anthony Browne, and therefore a stepdaughter
of Katherine’s friend, the “Fair
Geraldine”&mdash;failed to cheer her drooping
spirits.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I assure you, good cowsigne [cousin] Cecil,”
writes my Lord John to “Mister Chief Secretary,”
on September 20,1563, “as I have written unto my
Lord Robert&mdash;i.e. Dudley&mdash;the thought and care
she [Katherine] taketh for the want of Her Highness’s
favour pines her away; before God I speak it,
if it come not the sooner she will not long live
thus; she eateth not above six morsels in the meal.
If I say unto her, ‘Good Madam, eat somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to comfort yourself,’ she falls a-weeping and goeth
up to her chamber; if I ask her what the cause is
she useth herself in that sort, she answers me:
‘Alas! Uncle, what a life this is to me, thus to
live in the Queen’s displeasure; but for my lord
and my children, I would to God I were buried.’
Good cousin Cecil, as time, places, and occasion
may serve, ease her of this woful grief and sorrow,
and rid me of this life which, I assure you, grieveth
me at the heart’s roots.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">It is much more likely that Lady Katherine’s
distress was due to her enforced separation from
her husband and her eldest child, than to the
fact that she had lost the queen’s favour; though,
indeed, the consequences rendered Elizabeth’s
friendships invaluable and her enmities equally
dangerous. Nearly two months elapsed without
bringing any answer to the above-quoted letter;
and then Lady Katherine, very likely on her
uncle’s advice, addressed a formal petition to the
queen, which Lord John enclosed in another letter
to Cecil, begging him to have it presented to Her
Majesty on some appropriate occasion, and signing
himself&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Your loving cousin and assured friend to my
<i>smaule</i> power,</p>

<p class="pr2 reduct">“<span class="smcap">John Grey</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">This petition, like most of the letters to and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
from both Lord John and Lady Katherine at this
period, will be found among the Lansdowne MSS.
It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I dare not presume, Most Gracious Sovereign,
to crave pardon for my disobedient and rash
matching of myself without Your Highness’s
consent; I only most humbly sue unto Your
Highness to continue your merciful nature towards
me. I [ac]knowledge myself a most unworthy
creature to feel so much of your gracious favour
as I have done. My just[ly] felt misery and continual
grief doth teach me daily more and more
the greatness of my fault, and your princely pity
increaseth my sorrow that [I] have so forgotten my
duty towards Your Majesty. This is my great
torment of mind. May it therefore please Your
Excellent Majesty to licence me to be a most
lowly suitor unto Your Highness to extend towards
my miserable state Your Majesty’s further
favour and accustomed mercy, which upon my
knees in all humble wise I crave, with my daily
prayers to God to long continue and preserve
Your Majesty’s reign over us. From Pirgo the
vi of November 1563. Your Majesty’s most
humble, bounden, and obedient servant.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Either Cecil dared not present the petition to
Her Majesty&mdash;Lord John, in enclosing it, asks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
him to deliver it to Lord Robert Dudley&mdash;or else
the queen was more hardened than ever; for this
appeal also remained unanswered. A little later,
Lady Katherine, according to a letter from Lord
John to Cecil, dated December 12, “has been in bed
for three or four days,” and so ill that he thought
of sending for one of the queen’s doctors. She
was weeping all the time, and “assuredly, she
never went to bed all this time of her sickness,
but they that watched with her much doubted
how to find her in the morning. She is so
fraughted with phlegm, by reason of thought,
weeping and sitting still, that many hours she
is like to be overcome therewith.” “Indeed,” he
continues, “if it were not that the women attending
her were ‘painful’ [he means painstaking] he
could not sleep in quiet” for worrying about
her condition. He therefore begs Cecil to make
a fresh appeal on her behalf. The following day,
Katherine herself addressed a letter to Cecil,
beseeching the great man to intercede for her;
wishing to God she were buried rather than continue
to languish in her sorrow and misery, and
moreover intimating that she had also written to
Lord Robert Dudley, who had been created Earl
of Leicester on the previous 29th of September.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Apparently no answer from any one was ever
vouchsafed to these appeals.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1563-64, Newdigate, Hertford’s
step-father&mdash;who must have been a most
odious personality&mdash;began to interfere in the
affairs of Lady Katherine and her husband. He
spoke of Lord John Grey to Lady Clinton in the
most insolent terms&mdash;“with no small bragging
words”&mdash;and seems to have tried to persuade
Hertford that Lord John was his worst enemy.
He said that Lady Katherine ought not to be
sending letters to the queen or council without
his (Hertford’s) knowledge. Lord John Grey consequently
wrote to Cecil on January 20, 1564,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
describing the language Newdigate had used
about him to the Lady Clinton, and also pointing
out that Lady Katherine was very badly off for
furniture and house linen, etc., as she had scarcely
anything but what he had lent her,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> concluding
with a mysterious statement that “of the cat
there is no more to be had but the skin, which
hitherto I have thought well bestowed.” In a
postscript he begs that Lady Katherine may be
allowed some wine, if possible out of the royal
stores, and encloses an inventory of her effects.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
A document among the Domestic State Papers
of the reign of Elizabeth (vol. xxxiii. fol. 10)
shows us what response was made to Lord John’s
appeal. This is a receipt signed by the steward
of Pirgo<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> for money paid him for the lady’s
maintenance, and dated January 23, 1564. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
feeding of Lady Katherine and her attendants
cost £6 16s. 8d. a week. When we consider that
her retinue only consisted of a nurse, two women
(Mrs. Woodeforde and Mrs. Isham), two laundresses,
a groom, a footman, a page, and a lacquey,
besides Mr. William Hampton, who was a sort of
secretary, and compare the purchasing value of
money in those days with what it is in ours, it
becomes evident that My Lord of Pirgo was
making what we should consider a very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
thing out of his niece’s maintenance. Be this
as it may, in May 1564 Hertford received a
communication from Lord Robert Dudley (who
does not seem to have made use, at this time, of
his title of Earl of Leicester) and Cecil, asking
him to send some one with a sum of money to
pay my Lord of Pirgo’s charge for the maintenance
of his wife and infant. The amount was
stated to be £114, which had to be paid at once,
“because the said Lady Graye (as she complaineth)
cannot longer endure from payment.” It
will be remembered that in January of the same
year the steward of Pirgo had acknowledged full
payment of all moneys due to Lord Grey up to
date; it is somewhat strange, therefore, that four
months later, £114 should have been demanded
for her Ladyship’s expenses, and it is not unreasonable
to believe that Dudley and Cecil,
when they named so large a sum, intended to help
themselves liberally out of it. Whether Lord
John or the other two worthies ever got this money
or not, remains uncertain to this day.</p>

<p>Somewhere about Christmas 1563, the Duchess
of Somerset had gone to court, and had been
received in very friendly fashion by Robert Dudley.
For once in her life, Anne Stanhope seems to have
showed some feeling, and to have done her best
for her unfortunate son and his persecuted wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
But so far as we can judge, she set to work the
wrong way, as was her custom, insisting where
she should have pleaded, and so made matters
worse. On March 18, 1564, Hertford addressed
a personal appeal to Leicester on behalf of himself
and his wife, thanking him at the same
time for his kindness to the Duchess.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Leicester
replied, within a few days, that he had done everything
that “speech and humble art” could do,
but saw no sign of any more favourable feeling
towards the captives on the queen’s part:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
although “he had moved the Queen’s Majesty
in his [Hertford’s] behalf” it was all in vain.
Then&mdash;with an hypocrisy worthy of Uriah Heep,
considering he was universally suspected of
having murdered his wife, Amy Robsart, and
was jeered at as the queen’s paramour&mdash;he
unctuously adds, “Love God and fear Him, and
pray earnestly to Him, for it must be your chief
work that He may further your help to obtain
the favour and comfort you seek.” A week
later, Hertford writes him another letter, enclosing
a present of gloves for the queen, which he beseeches
him to present to Her Majesty. Leicester,
in answer to Hertford’s request that he should
tell him if there was anything wrong with them,
replied, two days later, that he had given the
gloves to the queen, and that there was no fault,
except that they were too thin, a defect he had
taken care to point out to “Thurgans,” the
servant who brought the gloves from Hanworth.
He adds that it would be well if the next pair
“you <i>make</i> a little stronger”; evidently the
earl employed his leisure in manufacturing gloves,
of which these were a specimen pair.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But neither
Cecil, nor Leicester, nor the Duchess of Somerset&mdash;who
continued to intercede for her son and her
daughter-in-law&mdash;nor the gloves, sufficed to mollify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the inflexible Elizabeth, who manifested no inclination
whatever to grant the unfortunate
prisoners what Hertford had termed “the countershine
comfort” of their freedom.</p>

<p>At this time Lord John Grey, too, joined the
chorus of appeals, addressing a letter<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> to Cecil
on March 6 (1564), in which he mentions that
he has not written for three months&mdash;probably
his last letter was the one sent together with the
inventory of Lady Katherine’s effects&mdash;points
out that they are now in the season of Lent,
“which of all others hath been counted a time of
mercy and forgiveness,” and again begs the
queen’s pardon for his charge and her husband.
“In faith,” says he, “I would I were the Queen’s
confessor this Lent, that I might enjoin her in
penance to forgive and forget, or otherwise able
to step into the pulpit to tell Her Highness that
God will not forgive her, unless she freely forgive
all the world.”</p>

<p class="pch">LADY KATHERINE AGAIN THE CENTRE OF
INTRIGUES</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1564, John Hales, Clerk of the
Hanaper, secretly published a pamphlet or book,
“wherein,” says Cecil, “he hath taken upon
him to discuss no small matter, viz., the title
[right] to the Crown after the Queen’s Majesty,
having confuted and rejected the line of the
Scottish Queen, and made the line of the Lady
Frances, mother to Lady Katherine Grey, the
only next and lawful.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This, the most open
declaration in favour of Katherine’s claim that
had yet appeared, naturally incensed Elizabeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
all the more so as it eventually transpired that
both the Chancellor (Sir Nicholas Bacon) and
Secretary Cecil had had a share in the preparation
of the book, though all the blame, when the
queen learnt of it later on, was laid upon Hales,
who, to add to his offence, had called in foreign
lawyers to prove the legality of Hertford’s marriage.
Hales was sent to the Fleet Prison for six
months, Bacon was severely reprimanded, whilst
Cecil, in a letter dated May 9, 1564, states that
he was “not free from the Queen’s suspicions.”
No doubt Elizabeth’s resentment against the
authors or suspected authors of this attempt to
favour Lady Katherine, was fanned by Lord
Robert Dudley, who took advantage of this
opportunity to strike a nasty blow at his
arch-enemy, Cecil, whom he accused of being the
author of the offensive pamphlet. The foreign
State Papers throw considerable light on the
events of this period, especially a letter from Don
Diego Guzman de Silva, the Spanish ambassador
ordinary, who came into office after the sudden
death of Quadra, and who, writing to the King
of Spain on June 27 (1564), says: “A great
friend of Lord Robert Dudley has been to visit
me on his behalf, and has informed me of the great
enmity that exists between Cecil and Robert even
before this book [i.e. Hales’s pamphlet] was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
published, but now very much more.... The Queen
is extremely angry about it [the book], although
she signifies that there are so many accomplices
in the offence that they must overlook it, and has
begun to slacken in the matter. This person
has asked me from Robert with great secrecy to
take an opportunity in speaking to the Queen to
urge her not to fail in adopting strong measures
in this business, as if Cecil were <i>out of the way</i>,
the affairs of Your Majesty [the King of Spain]
would be more favourably dealt with and religious
questions as well, because this Cecil and his friends
are those who persecute the Catholics and dislike
Your Majesty, whereas the other man [Lord
Robert] is looked upon as faithful.... If the Queen
would disgrace Cecil, it would be a great good to
them, and this man tried to persuade me to make
use of Robert.... With regard to this particular
business [of the pamphlet], also, I would be glad
to do as Robert desired.... I have advice reaching
me from all sides, and particularly from Catholics,
that this punishment [i.e. the disgrace of Cecil]
should be pressed upon the Queen.” Nevertheless,
these sinister schemes do not seem to have
come to anything, since Cecil did not receive
so much as a reprimand; but, as already stated,
he was well aware that he had aroused Her
Majesty’s suspicions of him, and doubtless, with
his characteristic acuteness, took good care to
do nothing that might compromise him further.
Lord John Grey was not so fortunate, though it is
difficult to see what he had to do with the affair;
but all the same he received a warning, and was
kept under arrest at Pirgo until his death. It
may be that, apart from the abortive Spanish
plot for the abduction of Lady Katherine, some
other conspiracy was on foot to place her on the
Throne, and that Lord John Grey was cognizant
of this scheme. Really the Greys’ motto might
well have been “Save me from my friends,”
for their worst enemies were their most eager
supporters&mdash;Lady Jane’s execution was the immediate
result of her father’s insurrection; and
Hales’s attempt to vindicate Lady Katherine’s
honour, only served to increase Elizabeth’s anger
against her and hers.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The loss of the queen’s favour had a depressing
effect on the health of Lord John Grey, who,
on May 20, 1564, in a curious letter to Cecil,
says it will no longer endure the strain of anxiety
caused by the care of his niece, the Lady Katherine,
adding that he has been very ill and fears he may
not live much longer. Late in November 1564,
Cecil wrote to Lord Robert Dudley to inform him
that Lord John Grey had died at Pirgo five days
previously [i.e. about November 21], “of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
his friends report that he died of thought, but his
gout was sufficient to have ended his life.” By
“thought” his Lordship no doubt meant “worry.”
Whether Lady Katherine stayed at Pirgo for her
uncle’s funeral, we know not: she may even
have left before his death, for Cecil, in his letter,
expressly states that at the time of writing she
was in the charge of Sir William Petre at Ingatestone
House in Essex. As this mansion is about
ten miles from Pirgo, she would have had no great
distance to travel&mdash;a mercy for her, in her weak
state. For the next eighteen months we hear
nothing of her; very likely she remained more
or less closely confined at Ingatestone, until
she was consigned, in 1566, to the care of Sir
John Wentworth of Gosfield Hall, near Halstead
in Essex.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Duchess of Somerset continued
her agitation on behalf of her son and his wife;
and in Lent 1565 (the letter is dated April 18),
she writes to Cecil and Dudley, begging them “to
take some occasion to do good in my son’s case.”
The former she also beseeched to “provoke”
[i.e. urge] Lord Robert; “trusting the occasion
of this Holy Week and charitable time for forgiveness,
earnestly set forth by his Lordship and you,
will bring forth some comfortable fruit of relief to
the long afflicted parties, wherein my Lord and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
cannot go so far, but God’s cause and the Queen’s
honour bid you go farther.”</p>

<p>The young Earl of Hertford had, as we have
seen, been removed from the Tower to his mother’s
house at Hanworth in August 1563. He soon
had good cause to regret the change, for the
duchess, who had always discountenanced his
marriage, made him feel his error in a most unpleasant
manner. She was, she said, “tired of
the whole matter,” and wished she “had never
heard of Lady Katherine or of her family”&mdash;no
good had come of it. She did not, however,
refuse to assist her son in his difficulties, but she
did so in an “unfriendly way,” so that the first
days at Hanworth must have been the reverse of
pleasant; particularly as the duchess’s husband,
Mr. Newdigate, made himself exceedingly disagreeable
and interfering. In May 1564, Hertford
was suddenly sent from Hanworth to the custody
of Sir John Mason&mdash;that very subtle man who
had desired he should be harshly dealt with&mdash;at
his house in Clerkenwell. The wording of
the royal warrant (dated May 26, 1564), which
commits the Earl of Hertford to his [Mason’s]
custody, “discharging him of Fr. Newdigate,
who is to confine himself to his own house,”
has given rise to the erroneous impression that
Newdigate also had been imprisoned at Sir John’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
mansion. It should probably read, “Discharging
him [i.e. Hertford] <i>from</i> Francis Newdigate,”
meaning that the earl’s step-father, who was in
these terms ordered to hand his prisoner over to
Mason, should have no further intercourse with
him, and therefore “confine himself to his own
house”&mdash;in other words, stay at home.</p>

<p>Misfortune seems to have attended most of the
ladies and gentlemen whom Elizabeth obliged
to act as jailers to her various obnoxious kinsmen.
They nearly all came to some grief or other. In
April 1566, Sir John Mason died somewhat
suddenly. After his death, Hertford lodged, for
a time, with his widow, from whose house, on
June 24 of the same year, he writes to Cecil
complaining that his brother, Henry Seymour,
“bears part of the penalty of the Queen’s displeasure.”
Was this young gentleman also involved
in the Hales business? In 1567, Quadra
tells us that the earl’s imprisonment had become
more strict, but omits to say where he was at
that time. On June 7 of the following year (1568),
he, however, reappears, when he addresses a joint
letter to Leicester, Mildmay and Cecil, in which
he says he is “much bound to the Queen”
for her “acceptation of his mother’s suit”&mdash;apparently
the duchess had met with some success
in her supplications on his behalf&mdash;and further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
thanks Her Majesty for “her intention to take
£700 a year till the £10,000 be paid.” The meaning
of this is not clear, unless it refers to the
payment of his fine, which however was adjudged
in marks, not pounds. Hertford was then living
at “Sir John Spencer’s.”</p>

<p>In 1566, as we have stated, his unhappy countess,
the Lady Katherine, had been sent to Sir John
Wentworth’s very dreary mansion, Gosfield Hall,
Essex.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The official order to receive her must
have been a heavy blow to Sir John, for on May
14 of that year he wrote a letter<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> to the privy
council, declaring himself a most “unmeet man
to receive such a charge, being of years above
threescore and sixteen, and of late much visited
with sickness”; and, he adds, “my wife for this
fortnight or three weeks hath been visited with
an ague, and doubteth much (but) that it will
breed to a quartain, who is above the years of
threescore and ten and cannot go so much as
unto her garden to take any air.”</p>

<p>Gosfield Hall must have at this juncture somewhat
resembled a hospital, for in addition to the
sick Wentworth and his wife, their daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the Lady Maltravers&mdash;or “Mattrevers,” as he
spells it&mdash;lay there “so ill that she could not see
anyone.” To crown all these objections, Sir
John informs the council that his house is the
last in which the Lady Katherine would be safe;
“for all the times in the night they may come to
the windows of every chamber in my house, or talk
with her or deliver letters unto her, or if she were
so disposed, she may either let them into her
chamber, or go out to them at the loops of the
windows, they are so great and wide.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Indeed,
he says, it would be better for him to be imprisoned
himself than to take up a task like this, which he
could not fulfil.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the poor man, Elizabeth
had visited Gosfield Hall on one of her progresses
(in 1561), and remembered the house well enough
not to place much faith in its being so very unsafe
a residence for her afflicted prisoner. No
notice accordingly seems to have been taken of Sir
John’s letter; and to Gosfield Lady Katherine
proceeded, with her retinue, her “monks,” her
parrots, and her pet dogs.</p>

<p>Albeit Elizabeth had good cause to wish her
to be kept very secure. On account of the agitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in her favour, Lady Katherine, though
imprisoned, was almost as great a thorn in the
queen’s side as if she had been free. The party
which supported her claims to the Throne was now
stronger than ever; although Spain kept aloof,
for the Spanish ambassador did not hesitate
to warn Elizabeth against allowing Katherine
to be nominated her successor, and once more
urged the queen to cut the question short by
marrying. Had it merely depended on a vote
in Parliament, Katherine would certainly have
been nominated, for the Ambassador remarks
that the Protestant party, who were greatly in
the majority in the Commons, were “furiously
in favour of her.” Doubtless this was precisely
the reason why the Spaniards had lost the interest
in her they had felt in past times, when she
declared herself a Catholic. At the head of the
movement was Cecil, whilst the Duke of Norfolk,
who still cherished the idea of uniting his daughter
to one of Katherine’s sons, gave him his hearty
support. On the other hand, the lords were
mostly in favour of the Queen of Scots, Catholic
influence being strong in the Upper House. By
the year 1566, the Protestant party in Parliament
was waxing so irritable at the queen’s persistent
refusal to name her successor, that during
the autumn session of that year, they boldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
threatened to refuse to vote Her Majesty further
financial supplies, unless she consented to come
to a decision in the matter. The tension was so
great, that on one occasion, about this time,
a regular hand-to-hand fight took place in
full Parliament, between Katherine’s supporters
and their opponents. Not daring, however, to
“starve out” Elizabeth in the way proposed,
the Protestant party next tried to bribe the queen
into consenting to their proposals, by offering
to vote her, without discussion, £250,000, on the
sole condition that she allowed them to nominate
her successor, in which case, it was thought, they
would choose Katherine as her heir. Elizabeth,
exasperated beyond endurance at such insolence,
this time replied that “on no account would she
allow this nomination to be discussed further,”
that she refused to make any conditions whatever,
and that they ought to have the decency
to vote supplies from motives of pure patriotism,
instead of from interest or party gain. The queen
must have felt that her position was very
insecure, else surely, with her characteristic vindictiveness,
she would have taken more drastic&mdash;and
in this case justifiable&mdash;measures against
those who had dared to offer her such an obvious
affront. On the other hand, what she told the
Spanish ambassador may have been true that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
“though she would concede nothing in this matter
of the succession, she wished to dissemble, and
let the Parliament talk, in order that she might
know what were their opinions and thus discover
the lady of each man’s choice,” meaning
Mary Stuart or Lady Katherine. Nevertheless,
“Gloriana” was considerably exercised in her
mind, for, the Ambassador continues, “she fears
that if the matter is carried further they will
adopt Katherine, both she and her husband
being strong Protestants, and most of the
members of Parliament are heretics, and are
going on that course to maintain their own
party.” For all that, she severely reprimanded
the Parliament in her prorogation speech, and
had a violent quarrel with Norfolk, Leicester
and other noblemen for daring to discuss the
matter; finally, she issued an order to the
effect that no allusion was to be made to it in
Parliament under pain of punishment. This order
was withdrawn soon after, but the question was
dropped. The agitation in Katherine’s favour
continued, however, in secret, and the Spanish
State Papers clearly demonstrate that the accusations
against Mary Stuart, of having connived
at her husband Darnley’s murder, were brought
forward by the Protestant party principally in
order to benefit Lady Katherine by injuring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
reputation of, and creating a prejudice against,
the Catholic Queen of Scots, the rival claimant
to the succession.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> On the night that Darnley’s
death became known in London (somewhere in
February 1567), Leicester sent his brother, the
Earl of Warwick, to Hertford, “to offer him his
services in the matter of the succession, and Lord
Robert himself went to see the Duchess of Somerset,
the earl’s mother, with the same object,
and has made friends with them both, contrary
to his former action.” He had hitherto supported
the Queen of Scots, and, as we have seen, had
been extremely averse to Lady Katherine’s claim.
It is strange, therefore, that he should have veered
round so suddenly, unless he felt convinced that
Katherine’s chances of succeeding Elizabeth were
now better than ever, and deemed it good policy
to be on the winning side. The result of these
interviews, the details of which are lost, is unknown;
probably Lord Robert’s suggestions fell
through, owing to Hertford’s habitual pusillanimity;
whilst the duchess is not likely to have
been over enthusiastic for the advancement of her
daughter-in-law, or desirous of seeing her son
get himself into still worse trouble by taking any
further ill-advised action. No doubt, moreover,
Elizabeth was aware that her captives were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
likely to become dangerous again, for in December
1567 we learn from the Spanish State Papers that
Hertford’s imprisonment became stricter than ever,
“they are,” he says, “possibly afraid of some
movement in his favour, as I am assured that certain
negotiations are afoot respecting the succession
to the Crown very different from the marriage
business.” What these were, he does not say,
but probably he alludes to the attempts to injure
Mary Stuart’s good name, in order the better to
forward Lady Katherine’s cause, or to Dudley’s
visit to the Earl of Hertford, which, if he were
still a prisoner at that time, must have been
arranged secretly, and was doubtless the principal
reason why he was treated with renewed severity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lady Katherine remained, for some
seventeen months, at Gosfield, until Sir John
Wentworth’s death, in 1567,&mdash;he too, so to speak,
died of Lady Katherine&mdash;obliged the queen to
make a fresh disposal of her luckless cousin.
Lady Wentworth still lived on, but “besides her
great age, which is seventy-one years, is grieven
by the sorrow of her late husband’s death so weak
and sickly as it is to be feared she cannot long
continue without she shortly amend.” It almost
looks as though Elizabeth had sent her unhappy
kinswoman to Gosfield with the deliberate intention
of driving her melancholy mad! The poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
soul stayed on for several weeks in the house of
death and mourning, until Mr. Roke Green,
Wentworth’s executor and agent, who was a
relative of the family, received the queen’s orders
to take charge of the prisoner, her child, and her
train&mdash;a charge he politely, but firmly, declined
to undertake, his house, he urged, being altogether
too small, whilst he himself had no wife, and “by
the occasion of the great charge of children I
have, I am much enforced to be from my house,”
which probably means that he was a sort of
guardian to a numerous group of orphans. He
might as well have spared himself the trouble
of writing his letter,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> which probably crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
one from the queen&mdash;dated Windsor, October 2,
1567&mdash;commanding him to convey the Lady
Katherine and her train to Cockfield Hall, Yoxford,
and commit them to the custody of Sir
Owen Hopton (who, so far as we can discover,
was not at this time, as some writers assert,
Lieutenant of the Tower). On the same day
(October 2), Her Majesty sent her commands
to Sir Owen to receive Lady Katherine and such
servants as were in attendance on her. The fear
of a fresh plot concerning Katherine and the
succession must have haunted Elizabeth, for in
making this order, she enjoins on Hopton to take
the following significant precautions: “Do not
suffer her to have any conference with any stranger,
nor that any resort be made unto her other than
by yourself and of your household. And in case
you shall be occasioned either for our service or
for neighbourhood (‘companionship’] to have
any repair to your table [i.e.&mdash;‘have any one to
sup or dine with you’], that she be not permitted
to be in company of them, but so to be secluded as
yourself and your wife be not thereby restrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
from the entertainment of any of your friends.
And generally we require you and your wife to
keep her as one committed to your charge from
conference or sight of strangers, according to the
trust we repose in you. And as occasion shall
arise wherein you shall desire to know our pleasure,
you may thereof advertise some of our privy
council, of whom you shall receive answer. And
for the charges of the debts of her and her necessary
servants attending upon her, you shall be
satisfied as by the foresaid Roke Greene you may
at more length understand was answered for the
same unto the said Sr. John Wentworthe.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Sir
Owen, who received the royal command on
October 6, manifested even more than Mr. Roke
Green, his reluctance to receive the princess, for
in a letter to “Cissyll” [Cecil] dated the 11th
of the same month, he pointed out that he was
just about to start with his wife and domestics
for a stay at a house he had bought at Ipswich,
an outing which the queen’s orders compelled
him to forego.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> After conference with Mr. Roke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Green, who appears to have gone to Cockfield
Hall to consult with Hopton, it was agreed that
Lady Katherine should remain where she was&mdash;apparently
at Gosfield Hall&mdash;till the 20th of
October. About that date, therefore, her Ladyship
left Gosfield for Ipswich, a distance of some
thirty miles. Owing to her delicate health, she
performed the journey in a “coche,” a ponderous
vehicle drawn by four strong Flemish horses, sent
from London for the purpose of her removal.
In this she sat with her nurse and child, deeming
it, no doubt, a very comfortable mode of travelling;
whilst her escort, forming a picturesque
group, followed on horseback. The party spent
a night at an inn in Ipswich; the landlord’s bill
of charges for their entertainment is still extant,
in the account sent to the Exchequer by Hopton
after Lady Katherine’s death. It runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The charges for the receipt of the Lady Katherine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and for the board of her and her ordinary
servants, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Imprimis; expended at Ipswich upon the
receipt of the Lady Katherine for one supper and
one dinner, fire, lodging and horsemeat there,
7li. 15s.</p>

<p>“Item; for one bait at Snape when the Lady
Katherine came from Ipswich to Cokfield (Cockfield),
20s.</p>

<p>“Item; for the hire of a cart for the carriage
of the stuff and apparel of the same Lady Katherine
from Ipswich to Cockfield, 20s.</p>

<p>“Item; given in reward for the coach, 10s.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p class="pch">LADY KATHERINE’S LAST ILLNESS AND
DEATH</p>

<p>VERY soon after her arrival at Cockfield,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
Lady Katherine, who was already in a deep
decline, fell dangerously ill. Sorrow, anxiety,
and hope deferred had done their work, and by
the close of 1567, Sir Owen Hopton decided to
send for Dr. Symonds, the queen’s physician, who
must have left for London somewhere in January
1568, since on the 11th of that month, Hopton
wrote to Cecil<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> that his charge was much worse
since Dr. Symonds’s departure.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> He adds that
he would like the queen to order her doctor to
return at once; “he then shall show his cunning
and God shall do the cure.” He did come back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
but as soon as he beheld the evidently dying
lady, he warned her weeping attendants that her
end was near. Sir Owen seems to have done
his best to alleviate Lady Katherine’s sufferings;
and his household books mention the despatch
of no less than three messengers to London with
news concerning her illness.</p>

<p>A remarkably interesting document, entitled
<i>The Manner of Her Departing</i>, is still extant
among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
All the night of January 26, 1568, says the writer,
Lady Katherine prayed incessantly, repeating the
orisons in the Book of Common Prayer, the service
for the Visitation of the Sick from the same,
and the Psalms. Her attendants endeavoured
to persuade her that she would live, but she,
being entirely reconciled to the idea of death,
would not listen to them. “Then said the Lady
Hopton to her, ‘Madam, be of good comfort,
for with God’s favour you shall live and escape
this; for Mrs. Cousins saith you have escaped many
dangers when you were as like to die as you
be now.’ ‘No, no, my lady,’ answered the
Lady Katherine, ‘my time is come, and it is not
God’s will I should live longer. His will be
done, and not mine.’ Then, looking on those
about her, she added, ‘As I am, so you shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
behold the picture of yourselves.’ About six or
seven of the clock in the morning, she desired
Sir Owen should be sent for, and upon his asking
her how she did, replied, ‘Even going to God,
Sir Owen, even as fast as I can.’ Then she
added, ‘I beseech you promise me one thing, that
you yourself, with your own mouth, will make
this request unto the Queen’s Majesty, which shall
be the last suit and request I ever shall make to
Her Highness, even from the mouth of a dead
woman, that she would forgive her displeasure
towards me, as my hope is she hath done. I
must needs confess I have greatly offended her,
in that I made my choice without her knowledge,
otherwise I take God to witness, I had
never the heart to think any evil against Her
Majesty; and that she would be good unto my
children, and not impute my fault unto them,
whom I give wholly to Her Majesty; for in my life
they had few friends, and fewer shall they have
when I am dead, except Her Majesty be gracious
unto them; and I desire Her Highness to be good
unto my Lord [Hertford], for I know this my death
will be heavy news to him; that Her Grace will be
so good as to send liberty to glad[den] his heart
withal.’” She next asked for her jewel-box,
and taking from it the ring with the pointed
diamond in it, which her husband had given her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
when they plighted their troth, she desired Sir
Owen to return it to him in her name, for “This
is the ring that I received of him when I gave
myself unto him and gave him my faith.” Sir
Owen, evidently remembering what had been said
by Hertford about the wedding-ring at the time
of his examination by Grindal and the commission,
inquired rather abruptly, “What say you,
Madam, was this your wedding-ring?” “No, Sir
Owen,” said the dying lady, “this was the ring
of my assurance [betrothal] to Lord Hertford:
there is my wedding-ring,” and she lifted another
ring, the one with the inscription upon it, out of
the box: “Deliver this also to my Lord, and
pray him, even as I have been to him (as I take
God to witness I have been) a true and faithful
wife, that he will be a loving and natural father to
our children, to whom I give the same blessing
that God gave unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
And then she took out yet another ring, with a
death’s head enamelled on it and the words,
“While I lyve yours,” and said, “This shall be the
last token to my Lord that ever I shall send
him; it is the picture of myself.” “After which,
noticing that her nails were turning purple, she
said, with a joyful countenance, ‘Lo, He comes!
Yea, even so come, Lord Jesus!’ Then, after
ejaculating the words, ‘Welcome death!’ she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
embracing herself, as it were, with her arms,
and lifting up her eyes and hands to Heaven,
and striking her breast with her hands, brake forth
with these words: ‘O Lord! for Thy manifold
mercies, blot out of Thy book all my offences!’
Whereby Sir Owen Hopton, perceiving her to
draw towards her end, said to Mr. Bockeham,
‘Were it not best to send to the Church that
the bell may be rung?’ And Lady Katherine,
overhearing him, said, ‘Good Sir Owen, let it
be so.’” Then, the parish-church of the neighbouring
village of Yoxford tolled the passing
bell. Some time&mdash;perhaps an hour&mdash;had elapsed,
when Lady Katherine, awaking as if from a
dream, and closing her eyes with her own hands,
murmured&mdash;just as her sister, Lady Jane Grey, had
done, when on the scaffold, fourteen years earlier:
“Lord! into Thy hands I commend my spirit!”
and “thus she yielded unto God her meek spirit
at nine o’clock in the morning of the 27th of
January 1568.” She was only twenty-seven years
of age at the time of her death.</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s persecution of Lady Katherine and
Hertford was very nearly, if not quite, as unrelenting
as Mary’s treatment of Jane Grey and
Guildford Dudley; but far less justifiable. Her
methods were those of Julian and not of Nero;
but quite as efficacious! Jane had been actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
placed on the Throne by a powerful party, had
been proclaimed queen, and had received the
homage due to royalty; whereas the scheme in
favour of Lady Katherine never took shape.
Besides, Elizabeth, who had succeeded in making
herself popular with a large section of the people,
was far more firmly seated on the Throne in 1563
than Mary had been in 1554, when her proposed
Spanish marriage had rendered her obnoxious
to a great number of her subjects. On the other
hand, Hertford had violated the law passed in
Henry VIII’s reign, punishing with the utmost
severity any subject who was so bold as to
venture to marry a princess of the blood royal,
especially if she was in the line of succession,
without the sovereign’s consent, ratified by Act
of Parliament. His fate might indeed have been
even worse, had not the Duchess of Somerset
represented Lady Katherine as the more blameworthy
of the two.</p>

<p>Lady Katherine’s remains were evidently embalmed,
for among the items in the list of expenses
incurred by Sir Owen Hopton we find the following:
“Itm’; for one Mr. Hannse S’geon, for
the cering of the corpse of the Lady Katherine,
3 li. Itm’; for spice, flax, rosin, wax, and the
coffin-making and for the serge clothes, 3 li.”
The funeral took place on February 21, 1568, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Yoxford Church. There were seventy-seven mourners,
but nobody of great note was present; and,
needless to say, Hertford was not allowed to attend,
even by proxy. According to Hopton’s account,
there was but a meagre display of the banners,
etc.,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> usual at state and semi-state funerals; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
it also indicates that the service was choral.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
A sum of £4 17s. 8d. was dispensed to the poor
after the funeral. There is no monument to
Lady Katherine Grey in Yoxford Church; but a
small black stone in the chancel was, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to local tradition, said to mark her resting-place.
As the words <i>Hic tandem qua vixere
concordia requiescant simul</i> (“At length they
rest <i>together</i> here, in the concord in which they
lived”) are inscribed on Hertford’s tomb in
Salisbury Cathedral, it is believed that Lady
Katherine’s remains were translated thither.
There is no clear documentary evidence that this
was the case, but the theory seems supported by
a statement in an MS. in the College of Arms
(Reyce’s MSS. relating to Suffolk), to the effect
that, “There lie buried in the church and chancel
of Yoxford, the <i>bowels</i> of Lady Katherine, wife
of Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford,” implying
that her <i>body</i> was interred elsewhere. Another
MS. relating to Yoxford states that the banners
and pennons, mentioned in Hopton’s accounts,
continued to hang in the chancel of the parish
church as late as 1594, and included, “for the
Lady Katherine, a target [i.e. coat of arms] of
England, and four standards of arms, two France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and England quarterly, a bordure, goboné argent
and azure.”</p>

<p>According to a pretty tradition still lingering
through the ages at Yoxford, a little pet spaniel
that had belonged to Lady Katherine, was, for
weeks, seen to come daily to her grave, upon
which it was one morning found dead. Much
the same story is related of a spaniel belonging
to Mary Queen of Scots, which followed her to
the scaffold and died of grief a few days after her
execution.</p>

<p>No trace is to be found in the State Papers of
any letters addressed by Katherine, either to her
sister Mary or to others, save Cecil, Leicester or
the queen, during all the time of her imprisonment.
Probably she was strictly prohibited from writing
to any one except these last three, and to them
only. Considering how actively Cecil supported
her cause, it seems a little unwise to have allowed
him to hold intercourse with her; but, no doubt,
Elizabeth kept watch also over him, and therefore
had nothing to fear from that quarter.</p>

<p>From 1568 onwards we hear nothing of Hertford
until, in June 1571, he addresses a letter to
Burleigh, “from my park of Tottenham,” in
which he speaks of “the endeavour to bring in
question great part of the title of my lands.”
The details of this dispute are lost, nor is any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
mention of this Tottenham property to be found
in the records of that place. A letter from
Queen Elizabeth, the date and destination of
which are uncertain, but which was probably
written in 1570, alluding to “a suit long dependent
between the Earl of Hertford and the
Lord Wentworth for certain concealed lands,”
doubtless refers to this matter. At that time,
Hertford seems to have been still in disfavour
with the queen; but soon after, matters
mended, for, according to Doyle’s <i>Official Baronage</i>,
on August 30, 1571, he was permitted to
proceed to Cambridge to take his degree as
Master of Arts.</p>

<p>The earl remarried some years after Lady
Katherine’s death. His second wife was a sister
of that Lady Sheffield who was at this time
secretly married to Leicester, and was a daughter
of Lord Howard of Effingham, and maid of
honour to Queen Elizabeth. This marriage
brought back to Hertford Elizabeth’s favour,
to such an extent that he entertained her with
great pomp at his estate of Elvetham in Hampshire,
in September 1591.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> He had no children
by his second wife, who died some years after her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
marriage. Hertford had a fine monument erected
over her remains; according to Dean Stanley,
he was also instrumental in erecting his mother’s
(the Duchess of Somerset) handsome tomb in
St. Edmund’s Chapel, Westminster. The Earl of
Hertford’s third wife was Lady Frances Howard,
another cousin of the queen, and widow of a
certain Mr. Prannel, a London wine merchant,
who had left her an enormous fortune. She
seems to have been a very haughty woman, who
gave herself such prodigious airs, that her husband
was fain to remind her, from time to time, of the
fact that before he married her she had been a
mere city dame: “Frank! Frank!” he would
call out&mdash;the lady’s name was Frances&mdash;“how
long is it since thou wert wedded to Prannel?”</p>

<p>Shortly after this marriage, Hertford once more
incurred the queen’s displeasure by attempting
to prove, before the Court of Arches, the legitimacy
of his eldest son by Lady Katherine Grey.
Elizabeth promptly lodged him in the Tower
again (in 1596), and his wife came up to London
to petition Her Majesty for his release. For nearly
six months she came daily to the palace, without
being received by Elizabeth, who seems, however,
to have treated her not unkindly, sending her
broths, meats, sweets and wine from the royal
table. After a good deal of trouble, Hertford was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
released, and probably from sheer fear of angering
Her Majesty anew, kept out of London till after her
death. Under James I he returned to court, and
in 1605 he was appointed ambassador to the archduke
regent at Brussels. He died in 1621 in his
eighty-third year, having survived his first wife
fifty-three years: the third Countess of Hertford
outlived him, and two months after his death,
married Ludovic, Duke of Richmond and Lennox,
being buried with him, in a fine tomb in Henry VII’s
Chapel in Westminster Abbey. Hertford lived long
enough to see the validity of his marriage to
Katherine Grey proved by the reappearance (in
1608) of the priest who had performed the ceremony.
He left no issue by his second and third
marriages.</p>

<p>Lady Katherine’s husband was buried under
a handsome but over-elaborate Jacobean monument
of various marbles, which stands at the east
end of the south aisle of Salisbury Cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
The recumbent effigies of the earl and Lady
Katherine praying, the former clothed in armour,
are remarkably fine; so, too, are the figures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the two sons, also in armour, kneeling on either
side. This monument is said to be the work of
an Italian sculptor, and bears a strong resemblance
to some of the tombs of the decadent
period in Venice.</p>

<p>The question of the succession, in relation to
the Grey family, did not close with the death of
Lady Katherine. Henry VIII’s will, the cause
of all the trouble, and Edward VI’s “Devise for
the Succession,” its confirmation, both placed
the children of the two Ladies Grey in the direct
line of the succession, a fact not forgotten by
Lady Katherine’s partisans, even in her lifetime.
Death having removed that lady, a
movement was started in favour of the claims
of her sons, then aged six and four years respectively.
Eight days after Lady Katherine’s
funeral, Guzman de Silva informed the King
of Spain, his master, that Leicester had obtained
the queen’s leave to go and visit his estates
and meet the Duke of Norfolk on the road,
“and it is now said that he will leave here
in five days, and that in Northampton the
duke and earl will meet together with the
earls of Warwick and Huntingdon and other
nobles, in order to arrange a new friendship.
Cecil and Leicester will also be reconciled, and
they will discuss the succession in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of Katherine’s death.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The result of this meeting,
if it ever took place, is not on record; but it
was rumoured in political circles at this time,
that one of the sons of Lady Katherine might be
eventually placed on the Scottish Throne, and
thus the conversion of that country to Protestantism
be absolutely assured, and probably its annexation
to England effected at the same time.
The greatest supporters of this scheme were Cecil
and the chancellor (Sir Nicholas Bacon), who, as
we have already seen, had all along consistently
favoured Lady Katherine’s claim. More remarkable
still, Elizabeth, although she abhorred the
idea that these boys, “brats” as she called them,
might one day occupy her Throne, endorsed the
scheme for placing one of them on that of Scotland.
Very likely she saw in this a chance of getting at
least the eldest out of the way of the English
succession. A letter written in June 1570 by
one Antonio de Guaras, a Spanish merchant or
banker who acted as a sort of spy in England,
during a period when there was no regular ambassador,
contains the following curious statement,
which had no doubt considerable foundation
in fact. The northern rebellion had only
recently been crushed, and Elizabeth demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of the Scotch, certain hostages, including Prince
James of Scotland, afterwards James I of England,
to be held as pledges of the future good behaviour
of our northern neighbours. The Scotch, says De
Guaras, would not accede to these demands,
“which would be their ruin, as the object of the
Queen of England, it is suspected, is to at once
kill the prince [James], and place on the [Scotch]
Throne the eldest son of Katherine, sister of Jane
who was beheaded, he being a heretic.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> It was
doubtless with some such object in view that
Elizabeth, as another Spanish envoy informs us,
was “bringing up with much more state than
formerly the two children of Hertford and Katherine,”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
from which we may suppose that poor
Katherine’s dying request had been conveyed to
the queen by Sir Owen Hopton, and that Elizabeth
acceded to it, if only from interested motives.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the vexed question of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
succession was not left in abeyance. In 1572,
Parliament met to discuss who should take Her
Majesty’s place in the event of her death, and the
claim of the young son of Katherine and Hertford
was supported by many of the members, although
others contested his legitimacy, and it was even
thought that the second son had a better chance,
because, according to the Spanish State Papers,
“his parents were married, before he was born,
with the consent of the queen and council.” It
is puzzling to make out what is meant by this
statement; either it is an error, or else indeed
the ecclesiastical courts had, on some date now
unknown to historians, reversed their previous
decision, annulling the marriage. Certainly the
legitimacy of the children of this marriage was still
doubted as late as 1574, since a document in the
British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> states that in October of that
year “the privy council were disputing warmly
as to the legitimacy of the sons of the Earl
of Hertford, and it was understood that they
unanimously agreed that they were not legitimate;
and that the legitimate heir (to the English
Throne) was the Prince of Scotland (afterwards
James I).”</p>

<p>In October 1572 Elizabeth had a recurrence
of exactly the same sickness which had so alarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
her subjects ten years before&mdash;the physicians
called it small-pox.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> She was soon once more so
near death that her life was despaired of: Sir
Thomas Smith, in a letter to Cecil, tells us “My
Lord Leicester sat up by her bed all night.” Again
the question of the succession was actively discussed,
and an unsigned letter addressed from
London to the Duke of Alva,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> dated the 26th
of October 1572, informs us that before the
precise nature of the queen’s complaint was
known at court, “the Earl of Leicester, the
Treasurer (the Marquis of Winchester), and the
Earl of Bedford were closeted together several
times to arrange, in case the queen died, to proclaim
king one of the two sons of the Earl of
Hertford by Lady Katherine; this being the
intention of the three lords in question and all
their party. The two boys,” the letter continues,
“are being brought up by their paternal
grandmother, the Duchess of Somerset.” Once
more the vigorous queen rallied, but falling ill
again in December of the same year, “the secret
murmurs in court, and amongst people all over
the country, as to what will become of the country
in case of the queen’s death, were very remarkable....
The Catholics wish in such case to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
proclaim the Queen of Scots, and the heretics to
take up arms against her and proclaim the son of
the Earl of Hertford.... They have passed
a law, making it treason to discuss the matter
during the queen’s life.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Her Majesty had at
this time once more refused to allow a successor
to be nominated.</p>

<p>By far the most curious allusion, in the Spanish
State Papers, to the plot for putting Hertford’s
son on the Scotch Throne is contained in a
collection of extracts from letters written by
Antonio de Guaras in December 1574. Mary
Queen of Scots was then a prisoner in the Earl of
Shrewsbury’s mansion at the Peak, whilst Lady
Margaret Lennox had just been sent to the Tower
afresh for marrying her son to Shrewsbury’s
daughter. The marriage had greatly incensed
“Gloriana,” who, probably with a deeper motive
than appears at first sight, ordered the Scottish
queen’s removal to the Tower of London. The
earl, however, protested so vigorously against
this, that Her Majesty changed her mind: but,
says de Guaras, after recounting this incident,
“The Queen of Scots was in great fear of such
a change, which must imperil her, the more so
as Killigrew<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> was leaving for Scotland, and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
ships were ready to accompany him; the object
being to obtain possession of the prince (James)
if possible, and put an end to both him and his
mother. They would then raise to power the
son of <i>the Earl of Hertford, whom they would marry
to a daughter of Leicester and the Queen of England,
who, it is said, is kept hidden</i>, although there are
Bishops to witness that she is legitimate. They
think this will shut the door to all other claimants.
This intrigue is said to be arranged very secretly.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>This plot, like so many others in the tortuous
labyrinth of the succession, came to naught; and
beyond a brief mention of the eldest son, Edward,
in connection with his father’s imprisonment
in 1596, the sons of Lady Hertford henceforth
disappear from the stage of history until the last
moments of Elizabeth’s complicated existence.
When, on March 23, 1603, the great queen lay
on her deathbed at Richmond Palace, her once
acute and clear mind wandering deliriously, the
Lords of the Council begged admittance, and
kneeling by the dying monarch, asked her whom
she wished to succeed her on the Throne she had
clung to so tenaciously in her active life. Her
Majesty was suffering too much in her throat to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
reply, so they desired her to raise one finger
when they named the person of her choice.
When the King of France and the King of Scotland
were named, she made no sign; but when
Lady Katherine’s eldest son (now Lord Beauchamp)
was mentioned, the dying queen, rousing
herself, exclaimed fiercely: “I will have no rascal’s
son in my seat, but one worthy to be a King.”</p>

<p>The following day the queen died, and King
James I was proclaimed. The party that favoured
Hertford or his sons deemed it wiser to drop the
matter, and the union of the English and Scottish
Thrones was effected, under “our Second Solomon,”
without opposition. Cecil’s son, forgetting
how his father had moved heaven and earth in
order that, first, Lady Katherine, and then, her
children, might succeed Elizabeth, and all the
paternal schemes and plots for King James’s
exclusion from the seat of power, became that
monarch’s most servile courtier. As to the much-talked-of
“sons,” they very wisely left the matter
of the succession strictly alone, and settled down
quietly as private noblemen. They both predeceased
their father, but the elder married,
and it was in the person of his son, William Seymour,
Lady Katherine’s grandson and the husband
of Arabella Stuart, that the family name was
perpetuated, and the title of Duke of Somerset
revived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a><br /><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c255" id="c255">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="pch">EARLY YEARS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life-story of Lady Mary Grey followed
almost precisely the same track as that of her elder
sister, Lady Katherine, with this difference, however,
that although Mary, too, made a clandestine
marriage, her husband was as completely her
inferior in rank as he was her superior in girth
and stature. She was a dwarf; he was a giant!</p>

<p>Born in 1545, the Lady Mary was contracted
to her kinsman, Arthur, Lord Grey de Wilton, on
the day her sister Jane was married to Lord
Guildford Dudley, and Katherine betrothed to
Lord Pembroke’s son. Froude is not correct
in stating that Lady Mary was <i>married</i> on
that day “to Martin Keys, a Groom of the
Chambers,” a statement which proves that he
knew nothing whatever of Lady Mary’s history.
She was then (1553) in her eighth year, and England
was on the eve of the tragedy of which her
eldest sister, Jane, was to be at once the heroine
and the victim, a tragedy speedily followed by her
mother, the Lady Frances, the widowed Duchess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of Suffolk’s indecorous marriage with her groom
of the chambers, Adrian Stokes.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Lady Mary’s
early betrothal was, however, annulled, mainly on
account of the terrible troubles that overwhelmed
the Dudley family.</p>

<p>All we know of Lady Mary’s childhood and
youth is an occasional mention of her name in
the State Papers, in connection with those of her
sisters, or in the correspondence, wills and bequests
of her family, and in accounts of visits to royal
and other illustrious persons, in which she accompanied
her parents. She is also mentioned in a
legal document, recently discovered in the Record
Office, as co-heiress with her sisters, of certain
landed estates in Warwickshire belonging to their
mother, the Lady Frances. Long after that lady’s
death, this document was submitted to Queen
Elizabeth, who apparently desired to know the
exact amount of her cousin’s fortune. It was not
large, but the queen none the less confiscated the
greater part. We know nothing of what became
of Lady Mary during the catastrophe which overwhelmed
her sister Jane.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> We can only conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
she was either abandoned to her nurses at Sheen,
or sheltered by some relative or friend of her
parents. In the first months of Mary’s reign, and
after some measure of order had been restored,
that queen, as we have seen, took compassion
on the two sisters, Katherine and Mary Grey,
received them at court and admitted them to
her privy chamber. Elizabeth also befriended
the two sisters, but far less generously. Lady
Mary received a pension of £80 a year from the
queen, paid through the Lady Clinton, mistress
of the royal household.</p>

<p>In 1559, Frances, Duchess of Suffolk, died, and
the Ladies Katherine and Mary Grey, who nursed
her during her last sickness, attended her funeral
in Westminster Abbey, their flowing trains “being
upheld,” as was then the etiquette for ladies of
the highest rank.</p>

<p>Lady Mary was in her sixteenth year, when,
two years later (1561), Lady Katherine Grey was
arrested for the unpardonable offence of choosing
her husband without reference to Queen Elizabeth’s
desires. Though dwarfish in stature (she was
only four feet in height, and the Spanish ambassador
describes her as being “little, crookbacked,&mdash;deformed&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
very ugly,”) freckled and red-haired,
like her sisters, Mary was a thorough
Tudor; for she, too, not only fell in love, but
resolved to marry the object of her passion on the
earliest possible opportunity, and this in spite of
the dreadful punishment that befell her sister for
a similar misdemeanour.</p>

<p>There was, in those days, an official at court&mdash;the
post did not fall into abeyance, indeed,
until the middle of the seventeenth century&mdash;who
bore the title of the “Porter of the Royal
Water-gates.” Each of the palaces on the
Thames possessed a river-gate and stairway, and
as Westminster was in times gone by the most
frequented of all the royal residences&mdash;the Tower
being only used on occasions of extreme state,
and very rarely at all by Queen Elizabeth&mdash;Master
Thomas Keyes, the Sergeant-Porter at this particular
gate,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> was a personage of considerable
importance; and even a remote connection of the
queen’s, for he was descended from the Knollys
family, into which Katherine Carey, daughter of
Mary Boleyn, Queen Anne’s sister, had married.
Master Thomas Keyes, therefore, was a notability
of a kind, with his right to boast kinship with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
great queen’s nearest and dearest relatives; and
Elizabeth, whatever may have been her faults,
never ceased to favour her mother’s tribe of
connections, not a few of whom were in very
humble positions indeed. When he first met Lady
Mary Grey, Thomas was in his prime, a widower
of some years’ standing, a good deal over forty,
and moreover the father of six or seven children.
He was the tallest and biggest man<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> about the
court, being six feet eight inches without his
shoes, but so stout, we are assured, that he “did
not look near so tall as he really was.” How and
when the Lady Mary formed this giant’s acquaintance
is never likely to be known, but she
must have seen him almost daily when her royal
mistress was in residence at Westminster, for she
had to attend upon the queen on her various water
excursions up and down the Thames, in those
times the chief thoroughfare of the city, teeming
with boats and barges of all kinds, just as the
Strand and Piccadilly now teem with motor-omnibuses
and motor-cars. Almost every one
of note, and many, indeed, who were of no note
at all, kept a boat of some sort, and found it as
useful as we find a wheeled conveyance. So
numerous and gorgeous were the craft floating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
upon the Thames, especially of a summer afternoon,
that foreigners averred there was nothing in the
whole world to compare with it, except on the
Grand Canal at Venice. Whenever that “imperial
Votress, Gloriana,” and her attendants moved to
and fro between Westminster and Greenwich,
or Richmond, or Hampton Court, the royal train
passed down the stairs of the Water-gate to the
queen’s barge, into which sumptuous, if somewhat
cumbrous, vessel Master Keyes, as in duty bound,
handed Her Majesty and her ladies.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Above this particular Water-gate there was a
fair and comfortable apartment, consisting of
several large rooms, overlooking the enchanting
panorama of the Thames, a thousand times more
picturesque at this epoch than at the present.
Here Mr. Sergeant-Porter dwelt in solitary state,
waited on by his cook and valet&mdash;for although,
when on his trial, he himself mentioned the
existence of his numerous progeny, no member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
it was living with him at the period in question.
Keyes, who seems to have been convivially disposed,
was in the habit of giving what we should
now call afternoon parties, to which he invited
some of the young people about the court, and
these gatherings, his own cousin, Lettice Knollys,
one of the most beautiful young women of the day,
and at this time greatly favoured by Queen
Elizabeth, was wont to attend. With Lettice, we
may rest assured, came the little Lady Mary, to
enjoy the cool breezes that were wafted through the
Gothic windows of Keyes’s water-mansion, whilst
she munched his marchpanes and sipped his
dainty coloured canary. Somewhere in the apartment,
probably, there was a virginal, lute, or
mandoline, out of which one of the fair girls
would contrive to extract melody, either to accompany
a ballad, or set nimble feet a-moving in some
lively jig or stately pavan. Be this as it may,
certain it is, that during the summer of the year
1565, the Lady Mary was in Keyes’s apartment
more often than was either seemly for so young a
maiden, or prudent for one so closely connected
with the queen.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c262" id="c262">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="pch">A STRANGE WEDDING</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 10th (some say the 12th) of August
1565, there were gay doings at Mr. Sergeant-Porter’s
lodgings. It was Mr. Henry Knollys’s<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
wedding-day, and after the ceremony, which was
graced by Elizabeth’s presence, the wedding party,
freed from the restraints of court etiquette, adjourned
to Keyes’s apartment, and there feasted,
danced, and romped till nine o’clock at night.
Among the merry company were Mrs. Lettice
Knollys and the Lady Mary Grey. One can only
conclude Mr. Sergeant-Porter had drunk more
wine than was good for him; otherwise he was
surely the veriest fool that ever lived, for immediately
the wedding guests had taken leave, he and
Lady Mary Grey were married by candle-light,
in the presence of a certain Mrs. Goldwell, an
attendant on Lady Howard (who acted as a
witness of the ceremony), the Sergeant-Porter’s
brother, Mr. Edward Keyes, Mr. Martin Cawsley, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Cambridge student, and “Mr. Cheyney’s man.”
A priest, described at the subsequent inquiry as
“a little fat old man, who wore a very short
gown,” was introduced upon the scene. No one
knew his name, or seems to have cared to find it
out. The persons present supposed he was a
Swiss Reformer in exile, “but he said the marriage
service in English, and according to the Book of
Common Prayer.” Remembering the doubts cast
upon the marriage of her sister Lady Katherine,
the Lady Mary secured plenty of witnesses to
assist at the ceremony; but it seems inconceivable,
and seemed so even in those days, that any sane
person should have ventured to mix themselves up
in such a scandalous business. Of course these
witnesses promised secrecy; and needless to say,
every man and woman of them broke pledge.</p>

<p>Within the week, Queen Elizabeth was made
aware of the whole matter. Lady Howard of
Effingham, and her woman, Mrs. Goldwell, were
among the first “to let the cat out of the bag,” for
the earliest letters on the subject of the marriage
are two which passed between Lord William
Howard and Secretary Cecil, the first-named
mentioning<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> that “the Queen’s Grace hath taken
this matter of the Lady Mary Grey’s marriage very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
much to heart.” Cecil, in a letter to Sir Thomas
Smith, clerk to the privy council, dated August
21, thus quaintly expressed his horror and
indignation: “Here,” says he, “is the most
unhappy chance and a monstrous. The Sergeant-Porter,
being the biggest gentleman at this Court,
hath secretly married the Lady Mary Grey, the
least of all the Court.” It must be admitted that
Queen Elizabeth had cause for anger this time.
The Lady Mary, her near kinswoman, a mere girl,
secretly married to a man of barely gentle birth,
a widower to boot, with seven children, and
entirely dependent for his livelihood on his menial
position in the queen’s own service! Had her
wrath exhausted itself in legitimate upbraiding
of her servant, and temporary banishment of her
indiscreet cousin, there would have been very little
to say against it; but Elizabeth had other and
more stringent views with regard to the disposal
of the Lady Mary and her fortune. She was
determined, she said, with one of her usual oaths,
to “have no little bastard Keyes,” succeeding
to her Throne, and she was evidently resolved to
ignore Master Keyes’s distant kinship with herself,
which was probably at the bottom of his audacious
conduct, for he felt convinced that in consideration
of this connection his august cousin would eventually
pardon him. It was not to be; forthwith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
like an eagle on its prey, Elizabeth swooped
down on the luckless pair. On August 22, not
a fortnight after the marriage, Master Sergeant-Porter
Keyes was consigned to the tender mercies
of the warden of the Fleet Prison. All the
witnesses, including the loquacious Mrs. Goldwell,
were arrested, and the wretched little bride herself
made over to the fearsome functionary known as
“The Mother of the Maids,” whose duty was to
look after the more ill-conducted of the “Virgin
Queen’s” juvenile attendants, and even, when
necessary, to birch them soundly. Whether Lady
Mary suffered under Mother Ansell’s rod we know
not; but from the 19th to the 22nd of August,
she was rigorously and continuously cross-examined
by the privy council as to the facts about
her marriage and the state of her fortune. Where
she remained during these inquiries is not clear;
Guzman de Silva, the Spanish ambassador, speaking
of the matter in a letter from London, says
“he [Keyes] is imprisoned in the jail here and she
[Mary] is incarcerated at Windsor.” It is known
that the queen and the court were at that
castle about this time; and it is not unlikely that
the Spaniard’s statement is correct; indeed it
would seem to be confirmed by a command issued
by Elizabeth to William Hawtrey, Esquire, of
Buckinghamshire, that “he do forthwith repair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to <i>Court</i>, and take into his charge and custody the
Lady Mary Grey, and convey her forthwith to his
house, ‘The Chequers,’ without permitting her to
hold conference with any one, or to have liberty
to go abroad, suffering only one waiting-woman
to have access to her. For Mr. Hawtrey’s
charges and expenses concerning the said Lady
Mary, the Queen’s Majesty will see him satisfied
in reason.”</p>

<p>The following is Lady Mary’s own account of the
marriage, as elicited during the above-mentioned
examination. Copies of her statement will be
found in the Record Office (State Papers, Domestic
Series, Elizabeth, vol. xxxvii., No. 71), together with
other documents relating to the marriage of Lady
Mary Grey with Mr. Keyes. The first paper,
written in Cecil’s very clear hand, contains a list
of questions put to the Lady Mary; and the
second, in a secretary’s exceedingly illegible scrawl,
gives her answers, more or less in her own words.
Asked when the marriage took place, Lady Mary
answered:</p>

<p>“The day of the marriage of Mr. Knollys&mdash;I was
married about nine o’clock at night by candlelight.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In the Sergeant-Porter’s chamber.”</p>

<p>“Who were present?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Sergeant’s brother, the Sergeant’s son, a
gentlewoman, Mrs. Goldwell, and the priest,
apparelled in a short gown.” She never knew
his name.</p>

<p>“What was he like?”</p>

<p>“He was old and fat, and of low stature.”</p>

<p>“Did the Sergeant-Porter give you anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a ring.”</p>

<p>Continuing, she said she supped in her own
chamber with Mrs. Arundell and two of Lady
Stafford’s young daughters. Within a quarter
of an hour after supper, she went to the privy-chamber
with Mrs. Goldwell, and from thence to
the council chamber&mdash;probably the most deserted
part of the palace at that time of night&mdash;where she
found Jones, his [Keyes’s] man, and sent him to
the Sergeant to show him that her letter was
ready.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> On this, Keyes came up to the council
chamber and thence they all went to his room over
the Water-gate, where the marriage ceremony
took place. Afterwards she returned to her own
chamber, where she found Mrs. Arundell. The
Sergeant gave her first two little rings, next a ring
with four rubies, and a diamond and a chain, and a
little hanging bottle of mother-of-pearl. Asked
what her means were, the Lady Mary answered
that she had £80 a year, paid out of the exchequer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
by the hands of my Lady Clinton, and £20
a year of her own, paid by the hand of one
Artell.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>“Keyes, Sergeant-Porter,” was examined on
August 19: he said the priest was one Thomas
Withers. “Edward Keyes, Mr. Cheyney’s man,
and Martin Cawsley, dwelling in Cambridge, did
attend the wedding.</p>

<p>“The marriage was in the Sergeant’s chamber
by the Water-gate at Westminster.</p>

<p>“The Lady Mary, being in the Council Chamber,
sent him word by a messenger that her letter was
ready. On this he came then and found her with
one Mrs. Goldwell, a servant of the Lady Howard.
He brought her to his chamber.</p>

<p>“He gave the Lady Mary at the marriage a
little wedding-ring.</p>

<p>“The marriage was by candle-light.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Arundell was at the Water-gate, but
was not let in before the marriage was over.
The Sergeant had carried up the Lady Mary to his
chamber before Mrs. Arundell came in.”</p>

<p>Then we have the examination of Frances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Goldwell.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> “She sayeth that one Robert Leonard,
a servant of the L. Chamberlens, came from
my Lady Mary, ‘to her coming from the cellar’
to ask her to come to her, and so she did finding
her in a chamber next the Counsell Chamber,
which was somewhat dark. Lady Mary told her
that she must go with her to her own chamber,
but instead she went by the gallery by the L.
Chamberlain’s chamber, down by the winding stair,
and so to a chamber which she knew not [this was
evidently the room over the Water-gate], and there
was eleven other people with the Sergeant Porter,
one of them being in a black cloke read from a
book, but what about she knoweth not. And
they tarried not there past an quarter of an
hower.</p>

<p>“She sayeth, moreover, the Sergeant Porter
came with her as she remembered into the gallery
before them and no further.</p>

<p>“The Lady Mary willed her to say that if she
should be asked where she had been, she should
say she had been with her in her chamber. She
sayeth at her return to the Counsell Chamber that
Lady Mary willed her to return to my Lady
Howard’s chamber, but whither the Lady Mary
herself went she knoweth not, unless it were into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the Privy Chamber.” [She probably returned to
Keyes’s room.]</p>

<p>As may be well imagined, the sagacious Mrs.
Goldwell’s master and mistress, the Lord and
Lady William Howard, were in a desperate state
of mind when they discovered the nature of the
business in which their “gentlewoman” had
meddled. They therefore immediately addressed
the following letter to Cecil:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On September 1, the Lady Mary was removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
to her place of exile, Mr. William Hawtrey’s
mansion, “The Chequers,” even then a very old
house, in a beautiful situation among the Chiltern
Hills. She was accompanied by the aforesaid
Mr. William Hawtrey, his serving-man, and one
of her own maids, the procession being closed by
some pack-horses. Magnificent as was Mr. Hawtrey’s
garden at “The Chequers,” and beautiful
the surrounding country, it does not seem to have
in the least impressed Lady Mary Grey, whose only
thought was to regain her freedom. She wrote
to Cecil towards the end of the year 1565, in the
following rather pathetic terms: “I did trust
to have wholly obtained Her Majesty’s favour
before this time, the which having once obtained
I trust never to lose again. But now I perceive
that I am so unhappe a creature, as I must yet be
without that great and long-desired jewel till it
please God to put into Her Majesty’s harte to
forgive and pardon me my great and heinous
crime.” It seems that Mr. Hawtrey cheerfully
joined in the chorus of appeals, for he was considerably
bored by his aggrieved and unwilling
guest, and earnestly wished to be rid of her. Lady
Mary was persuaded that she might appease the
queen’s wrath, if she could but have an interview
with her, and when Elizabeth was paying a visit
to Lord Windsor at Bradenham, not far distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
from the little captive’s abode, she again wrote to
Cecil, begging that she, “The Queen’s prisoner and
most poore wretche, might have access to Her
Majesty’s Grace, for the purpose of pleading for
herself in person.” Elizabeth, to use an everyday
expression, was not going to be bothered with her,
whilst Cecil was more interested in her sister
Lady Katherine than in “the most poore wretche,”
who was therefore refused her much desired boon.</p>

<p>The Lady Mary Grey remained at her retreat
in the Chilterns more than a year. At last, however,
Mr. Hawtrey, to his great relief, received
orders to bring his prisoner up to London. It had
been at first intended to consign her to the tender
mercies of the Duchess of Somerset, but that lady
dying before the negotiations were completed,
Mary was handed over to her step-grandmother,
Katherine, dowager Duchess of Suffolk. This
inhospitable relation was anything but pleased
when, one summer’s evening in 1567, Mr. Hawtrey,
the Lady Mary, and her servants, knocked unexpectedly
at the doors of her house in the Minories.
The duchess, it may be added, had no right
whatever to this mansion, which had been carved
out of the stately convent of the Holy Trinity,
which was granted by Edward VI to the Duke
of Suffolk, whose legitimate successor, failing
Lady Katherine Grey, was the unfortunate young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
lady now conducted to its door as to a sort of
prison.</p>

<p>The duchess received her unwelcome guest with
“dure countenance,” but attributed her annoyance
to the score of her unpreparedness, for a few
days later she wrote to Cecil asking him, “Where
is the Lady Mary’s stuff? For that, indeed, I
have nothing wherewith to furnish or dress up
her chamber, as the Minories is totally unfurnished.
I do not usually reside there. My dwelling is
in Leicestershire; and when I am in town I myself
borrow stuff of the Lady Eleanore.” If she had
to receive Lady Mary, she protested, she would be
“forced to borrow furniture from her neighbours
of the Tower.” Probably Cecil communicated
the duchess’s grievance to Mr. Hawtrey, for by
way of answer to her letter, he sent all the Lady
Mary’s goods in his possession to the Minories, at
the same time pointing out that they had not
hitherto been used; he seems, at least, to have
provided his charge with a comfortable lodging
during her stay at “The Chequers.” No sooner
was the parcel of “stuff” opened, than the
sarcastic dowager duchess wrote a letter to “Mr.
Sekrettory” Cecil, describing the contents in a
manner which reflects less credit on her heart than
on her powers of derision. “She hath nothing,”
she says, “but an old livery feather bed, all to [too]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
torn and full of patches, without either bolster or
counterpaine, but two old pillows, one longer than
the other, an old quilt of silk, so tattered as the
cotton of it comes out, such a piteous little canopy
of red sarcenet as is scant good enough to cover
some secret stool.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Then there are two little
pieces of old hangings, both of them not seven
yards broad.” This letter was written at Greenwich
Palace,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> whither the Lady Mary had been
removed by her step-grandmother very shortly
after her arrival in London, perhaps the very same
day; and the real object of this exposure of the
Lady Mary’s poverty was to induce Cecil to
persuade the queen to assign the duchess some
of the furniture in the Tower store-houses; for
she concludes by asking that Mary may be allowed
to have some “silver pots to fetch her drink in,
and two little cups for her to drink out of, one for
her beer, the other for her wine. A silver basin
and ewer were, I fear, too much to ask.” The
dowager duchess promises to return all borrowed
articles in as good condition as she received them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
She says the Lady Mary is “very glad to be with
her”(!); although “all she hath eaten now these
two days is not so much as a chicken’s leg.” Very
likely, the duchess’s sarcasms and her own
grievances were making the poor little lady absolutely
ill. However, these first difficulties having
been surmounted, she lived on fairly happily with
her kinswoman at the Minories and elsewhere,
until June 1569. During this period she became
godmother to a little girl, Jane Merrick, who
eventually inherited some of her property. She
also struck up a great friendship with Lady Mary
Bertie or Bartie, wife of Mr. Peregrine Bertie,
Duchess Katherine’s son, and heir to the barony of
Willoughby d’Eresby: Lady Mary Bertie was of
the family of De Vere, a daughter of the Earl
of Oxford. In the beginning of the year 1568,
Lady Mary Grey’s position was complicated by the
death of her sister Lady Katherine, which exposed
her to the danger of being chosen the figure-head
of any party that professed belief in the legitimacy
of Henry VIII’s will and Edward VI’s “Devise
for the Succession.” There is reason to believe
that Mary, warned by her sister’s fate, had made
up her mind formally to renounce her right to the
Throne, lest unscrupulous persons might force her,
as they had forced her sister Jane, into this false
position. Elizabeth, however, harried by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
continual fear of an usurper or even of a successor,
gave orders, in June 1569, that Mary Grey should
be removed to the care of Sir Thomas Gresham,
whose magnificent mansion occupied the space
between Bishopsgate Street and Winchester Street,
and was surrounded by the pleasant gardens
of Crosby Hall and Winchester House. The
Greshams used Osterley House, towards Hounslow,
now the seat of the Earl of Jersey, as a country
retreat; and also lived for a time at Mayfield in
Sussex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Keyes was enduring a good deal
of hardship in the Fleet, the foulest of the many
foul prisons of those days. His grievances and
annoyances were many and peculiar. He was
apparently engaged in some suit, unconnected
with his marriage, and his lawyers were allowed to
visit him in the Fleet and talk to him in the
presence of the warden. Moreover, there was
some project for his being sent to Ireland, though
whether as a prisoner we know not. There exists,
however, a letter from Keyes, dated “Fleet
Prison, July 16, 1566,” in which the imprisoned
Sergeant-Porter begs Cecil to “give him instructions
how to act, as to his going into Ireland.”
The wording of this suggests that he was to have
held some official position there. The scheme
apparently came to nothing, for on July 25 of the
same year, he prepared a petition to the effect that
he would renounce his wife and have his marriage
declared null and void, if only he might be allowed
to leave the Fleet and retire into Kent, urging
that, after all, “he had formerly done the Crown
good service in suppressing insurrections”&mdash;a
reference, no doubt, to some share he must have
had in the defeat of the Wyatt rebellion. Dr.
Grindal, then Bishop of London, refused, however,
to annul the marriage, and referred the matter
to the Court of Arches, which, so far as can be
ascertained, also refused&mdash;at any rate Keyes was
asking leave to cohabit with Lady Mary as late
as in 1570. But his lordship’s Christian charity
permitted him to suggest that the bulky captive
might well be allowed to go into the country to
take some open-air exercise, “for his bulk of body
being such as I know it to be, his confinement in
the Fleet putteth him to great inconvenience.”
This suggestion was accepted, and for a few
months Keyes was allowed to walk in the garden
attached to the Fleet Prison; but a new warden
was appointed in December 1566, and this slight
solace was taken away; and further, instead of
being allowed, as hitherto, to cook his own food,
the ex-Sergeant-Porter was compelled to live on
the horrible diet provided by the prison authorities.
In this same December he complains to Cecil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
that “he had been given a piece of beef which
had been dropped into some poison, prepared for
a dog that had the mange!”</p>

<p>It did not kill him, if indeed that had been
intended, but he fell so ill as to require the attentions
of a certain Dr. Langford, who charged him a
mark [i.e. 6s. 8d.] for his services. The prisoner
lived on; to send another letter to Cecil, complaining
that “they have taken away from me my
stone-bowe wherewith I was wont to shoot at
birds out of my prison-window, for the refreshment
of myself sometimes; but even this little solace is
denied me.” Probably the neighbours objected
as much as the birds!</p>

<p>At last, when unkind wardens, poisonous food,
and lack of fresh air had thrown the unfortunate
Sergeant-Porter into a “languor,” he was relegated,
in accordance with Dr. Grindal’s suggestion,
to his native place, Lewisham, then a remote
village, now a large town within half-an-hour’s
journey of London&mdash;it probably took Mr. Keyes
some hours’ hard riding to reach it on horseback.
Thence he continued to appeal for the queen’s
pardon, “if only for the sake of my poor children,
who innocent as they are, suffer punishment with
me for my offence.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> If it were Her Majesty’s and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
your honour’s [Cecil’s] pleasure to fetter me with
iron gyves, I could willingly endure it; but to
bear the cruelty of this warden of the Fleet,
without cause, is no small grief to my heart.”
Evidently memories of the stern official haunted
the poor fellow in his rural retreat. From Lewisham,
Mr. Keyes went to Sandgate Castle on the
Kentish coast. Thence, in May 1570, he addressed
a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury, beseeching
his grace to intercede for him with the queen,
“that according to the laws of God I may be
permitted to live with my wife.” This is rather
a change of feeling from the time, four years previously,
when he expressed his willingness to
have his conjugal fetters snapped, if only he might
retire to Kent! The archbishop did not grant
this prayer; and Mr. Thomas Keyes died&mdash;probably
in September 1571, and very likely at
Sandgate: his burial register is lost, and there
is no proof that he returned to Lewisham&mdash;worn
out by his manifold troubles and by the effect of
his unhealthy existence in the Fleet Prison.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c282" id="c282">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="pch">THE LAST YEARS OF LADY MARY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mary Grey’s</span> life with the Greshams
was more uncomfortable by several degrees than it
had been with the dowager duchess. Sir Thomas
seems to have disliked her heartily, and his wife,
Lady Gresham&mdash;who, by the way, had been a
milliner, and who still, notwithstanding her husband’s
wealth, occasionally made caps for Queen
Elizabeth&mdash;called the poor little woman the “heart
sorrow of her life.” The couple therefore strained
every nerve to get their unwelcome guest removed.
Letter after letter did Gresham send to Cecil and
to Leicester, not complaining of any particular
ill-conduct on Lady Mary’s part, but merely putting
forward reasons for her departure. First, his
wife wants to ride into Norfolk to see her old
mother, and the Lady Mary is some sort of
hindrance to her journey; then, one of his servants
at Osterley has the plague and they want to get into
the country. In all these compositions the writer
reckons up, to a day, the time Lady Mary has been
in his house, to his wife’s “bondiage and harte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
sorrow.” Sometimes he even offers to pay well
for her removal; but the powers that were, gave
no heed to these agonized complaints and appeals.
Hence Lady Mary was still at Gresham House
when, early in September 1571, Dr. Smythe, her
doctor, came to inform Sir Thomas that the
obnoxious ex-Sergeant-Porter had passed out of
the reach of “this warden of the Fleet” for all
eternity. The poor little widow was deeply
distressed; “his death she grievously taketh,”
wrote her host-jailer to Cecil; “she hath requested
me to write to you to be a mean to the Queen’s
Majesty to be good to her, and that she may have
Her Majesty’s leave to keep and bring up his poor
children.” This care for her step-children is a
pleasant side-light on Lady Mary’s kindness of
heart. “As likewise,” continues Sir Thomas,
“I desire to know Her Majesty’s pleasure, whether
I shall suffer her to wear any black mourning
apparel or not.” Then he recurs to his old bone
of contention: “Trusting that now I shall be
presently [soon] despatched of her by your good
means.” Shortly after this, Mary, having retired
to Osterley Park, wrote to Cecil that “as God had
taken away the cause of Her Majesty’s displeasure
[i.e. Mr. Keyes] she begged to be restored to her
favour.” This letter was signed “Mary Keyes,”
which apparently gave offence, for the next letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
was from plain “Mary Grey,” and she never repeated
the obnoxious appellation of Keyes. Still
she was not removed, and still the Greshams
importuned: at length, after a final appeal (for
“the quietness of my poor wife”), Sir Thomas rode
up to London to make a personal request. Mary
would seem to have been as anxious to leave her
unwilling host and hostess, as they were to get rid
of her, and greatly desired to take up her residence
with her step-father, Adrian Stokes, Esq., then living
in the Charterhouse at Sheen, who had kindly
offered to receive her. But Sir Thomas’s personal
efforts were not crowned with success, and the
young widow had to spend the winter of 1571-72
with her inhospitable hosts at Mayfield in Sussex,
where they had a country seat.</p>

<p>In March 1572, a letter from Sir Thomas Gresham
to Cecil, then Lord Burleigh&mdash;or as he calls him
“Lord Bowerly”&mdash;indicates that his oft-expressed
desire for the removal of his charge was now
nearing accomplishment, and he proceeds to
clinch the matter by an offer which is nothing
less than bare-faced bribery. “And whereas,”
says he, “I have allowed my lord of Oxford
[Cecil’s son-in-law] for his money but after the
rate of ten per centum, I shall [now] be content
to allow him after twelve per centum with any
other service I can do for him or you.” This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
offer of increased interest was too good to be
neglected, and before June of the same year, Mary
was free to go where she would&mdash;liberty had come
at last. In a pathetic letter dated May 24, 1572,
the released prisoner describes herself as “destitute
of all friends&mdash;only God and Her Majesty,” and
only possessing £80 allowed her by the queen, and
£20 per annum of her own. Her “father-in-law”&mdash;meaning
of course Adrian Stokes, her step-father&mdash;will
give her nothing, for he has married again.
She had expectations which would slightly better
her actual income: by a reversion of the dowager
Duchess of Suffolk she was to receive £333 6s. 8d.
and the same sum at the death of Adrian Stokes.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
By the summer of this year (1572), Lady Mary was
settled with her step-father in the Charterhouse;
and Sir Thomas Gresham wrote to express his
heartfelt thanks to Cecil for his “delivery [i.e.
deliverance] from the Lady Mary.”</p>

<p>After this, Master Keyes’s widow seems to have
dwelt in peace till the end of her days. She
addressed no further complaints to Cecil, and her
will proves that her financial position was a fairly
good one. Her name figures no more in the State
Papers: she seems to have dropped completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
out of sight and out of mind. We know, however,
that she eventually either returned to the dowager
duchess at the Minories, or occupied that lady’s
house in the Barbican;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and that on New Year’s
Day 1577 she presented the queen, then at
Hampton Court, with “four dozen buttons of
gold, in each of them a seed pearl, and two pairs
of sweet [i.e. perfumed] gloves,” a gift acknowledged
by Elizabeth, who gave her kinswoman a
silver cup and cover, weighing eighteen ounces:
apparently Mary occasionally went to court, and
enjoyed the royal favour, at least to some extent.</p>

<p>An entry in the royal household books for
1576 states that Lady Mary Grey stood sufficiently
well in the queen’s graces to be at Hampton
Court during the great revels held there at Christmas
time. The list of guests who presented gifts
to Her Majesty opens with the names of her two
cousins, the Lady Margaret Lennox and the Lady
Mary Grey. The latter presented a gold cup;
Leicester, a carcanet glittering with diamonds,
emeralds and rubies; Burleigh, a purse of £30; and
the Lady Derby, “a gown of satin broidered with
peacocks’ feathers in silk.” Even the humblest
servant gave some trifle to the greedy queen, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
by this means generally obtained something like
£10,000 per annum, as voluntary contributions&mdash;we
will not vouch much, however, for the sincerity
of the “voluntary.” The queen’s gifts generally
amounted to less than £2000, and, with the exception
of those given to members of the royal
family, were the merest trifles in silver. She was,
however, fairly generous, as a rule, to the poorer
menials, giving them warm clothing and blankets.</p>

<p>Lady Mary died, of what complaint we do not
know, on April 20, 1578, aged thirty-three, her
death being hastened, no doubt, by her griefs
and miseries. She may have been buried at St.
Botolph’s-without-Aldersgate, but some authorities
think otherwise, and even state that her place of
burial is Bradgate Church. In Stowe’s <i>Survey</i>
occurs an entry to the effect that the Lady Mary
Grey shares her mother’s tomb in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>Lady Mary’s will is not only a fine specimen
of sixteenth-century orthography, but proves that
she possessed more property than is generally
supposed. The document (which is in the Lansdowne
MSS. at the British Museum, xxvii. 31)
begins: “In the name of God Amen. The xvij
daye of Aprill in the yeare of our lord god 1578.
And in the xxth yeare of the Raigne of our
Soveraigne Lady Elizabethe.” Lady Mary Grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
describes herself as “of the p’ishe of St. Botolphe
w<sup>th</sup>out Aldersgate,” a “widowe of wholl minde
and of good and perfect remambraunce laude and
praise be unto Almightie God.” She commits her
“soull” to the care of its Maker, trusting in
salvation through Christ “without any other
waies or meanes.” Her body is “to be buried
where the Quens Ma’tie should think most meete
and convenient.” This seems to suggest that
she was still under royal supervision. To the
dowager Duchess of Suffolk, her step-grandmother,
she bequeathes “one paere of hand Bracelettes of
gould with a jacinte stonne in eatche Bracelette wh
Bracelettes were my ladie grace my late mothers
or els my Juell of unycornes horne wchsoever herr
grace refusathe I geave and bequeathe to my verie
good ladie ye lady Susanne Countesse of Kente.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
It is curious that she should “geave to my verie
frend Mrs. Blaunche a Parr a little gilt bowlle
w<sup>th</sup> a cover to it.”<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> It was possibly thanks to
Blanche Parry that Lady Mary obtained some
measure of favour and liberty in her last years.
She leaves to the “Fair Geraldine,” now Countess
of Lincoln, a girdle of goldsmith’s work and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
gold buttons. To Lady Mary Bertie&mdash;she spells
it “Bartye,” even as it is still pronounced&mdash;and
to her husband, Mr. Bertie, she leaves her best gilt
cup and the best silver and gilt salt-cellar. She
bequeathes to Mary, Lady Stafford, a “tablet of
gould with an aggett in it”; and to Anne, Lady
Arundel, a “tankarde of sylver.” To a certain
Lady Margaret Nevill, she leaves a number of
gowns of velvet and satin; to Lady Throckmorton,
a “boulle” of silver, with a cover; to her
god-daughter, Jane Merrick, she leaves “one
good fethered bedde and a boulstere to the same
and the three peres of hangings which I have of
myne owne and a cowple of covered stoolles.”
Were these the identical objects that had excited
the dowager duchess’s scorn? Lady Mary next
disposes of the lease of “my house wherein I
now dwell,” which she wishes to be sold, the
purchase money being assigned to “Marrie Merrick
my goddaughter” in trust of Edmund “Haull my
cowsen.” This plainly indicates that at the time
of her death she was in a house of her own, and not
at the Duchess of Suffolk’s; and the will also proves
her to have been rich enough to keep her coach.
Mary Merrick must have been a sister of the
testator’s godchild, Jane Merrick, since she is
expressly stated to have been not yet twenty-one
years of age. After various bequests to divers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
persons, she leaves to Anne Goldwell, evidently
the witness of her unhappy wedding, “half a
dozen silver spoones and twoe trenchers plattes
of silver.” “Henrie Gouldwell,” very likely that
lady’s husband, receives “my baie coatche
geldings.” The residue “of all my goods and
catteles [chattels] both moveable and immoveable,”
are to be applied to the payment of her debts.
Finally, Mr. Edmund Hall<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and Mr. Thomas
Duport&mdash;the latter her cousin by marriage&mdash;are
appointed executors.</p>

<p>There is no authentic portrait of this poor little
princess extant; she was possibly never in a
position to have one taken. Nor do we know much
of her personal appearance or character. There
is no evidence of her having been accomplished
in any particular way; still, Gresham, even at the
height of his desire to be rid of her, brings against
her no accusation of bad temper or undue
haughtiness. Most likely she was merely peevish
and melancholy, which is not surprising when we
remember that she was separated from her
husband of a week, and deprived of her freedom.
Her very dismal library, which she possessed to
the time of her death and had carted about with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
her wherever she went,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> suggests that she was
acquainted with French and Italian, and greatly
interested in religious matters, being a strong
Protestant. Her library includes Palgrave’s
French Dictionary and Grammar, and an Italian
Commentary on the Scriptures, as well as the
following works of sombre old-world philosophy
and theology: <i>Mr. Knox, His Answer to the
Adversary of God’s Predestination</i>; <i>Mr. Knewstubbe’s

<p>Poor little woman! When Gresham literally
turned her out of his house, with one man and
a cartload of her belongings, her sacred library
was amongst her greatest treasures. “She hath

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c293" id="c293">LADY ELEANOR BRANDON, AND
HER HEIRS</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader may be interested to know something
of the story of the Lady Eleanor, Countess of
Cumberland, younger sister of the Lady Frances
Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk, and another of the
many claimants to Elizabeth’s succession, whose
name has been frequently mentioned in these
pages.</p>

<p>The queen-duchess, Mary Tudor, it will be
remembered, had only two daughters who survived
her, the Ladies Frances and Eleanor, by her
second husband, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.
Many considered the Lady Eleanor’s claim to
the Throne superior to that of her elder sister,
because at the time of her birth, Lady Mortimer,
Suffolk’s second wife,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> was dead; whereas she
was still living, and clamouring for her rights, when
the Lady Frances came into this world. Henry
VIII’s will, however, mentioned the Lady Frances
and her children, for he had long since refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
question the validity of his sister’s marriage with
Charles Brandon, or in any way to recognize the
position of the Lady Mortimer, who, it should be
remembered, remarried with a certain Mr. Hall&mdash;according
to Dugdale&mdash;and thus placed herself out
of court.</p>

<p>The Lady Eleanor Brandon was a better-looking
woman than her sister Frances. When her tomb
in Skipton Church was disturbed, in the seventeenth
century, her skeleton, which was in perfect
condition, proved her to have been “very tall
and large boned,” whereas the Lady Frances was
of medium stature. Lady Eleanor, if we may
judge by her portrait, which hangs at Skipton
Castle, was pretty, rather than beautiful. The
writer confesses that the portrait at Skipton did
not impress him as that of one who could have put
forward the slightest pretensions to good looks;
the cheeks are high, the forehead abnormally
broad, the eyes, however, are fine, and the hair,
fair; but the complexion, according to this
venerable picture, must have been quite ghastly.
The portrait is very badly painted&mdash;a poor thing,
worth little as a work of art, but none the less
interesting.</p>

<p>On the same day that her sister Lady Frances
married Henry Grey, Marquis of Dorset, in
March 1533, occurred the betrothal of the Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Eleanor to Lord Henry Clifford, the eldest son
of the Earl of Cumberland, who was remotely
related to Henry VIII; his grandmother, Anne
St. John of Bletsoe, being cousin once removed
to Margaret, Countess of Richmond, the king’s
grandmother. The marriage took place in the
summer of 1537 at Suffolk Place, probably in the
Church of St. Mary Overies&mdash;now incorporated
in the recently created Cathedral of Southwark&mdash;and
in the presence of Henry VIII and his court.
In honour of the wedding, the Earl of Cumberland
built two towers and a gallery at Skipton Castle;
and we are told that these additions to the princely
old mansion were completed in less than four
months&mdash;a surprisingly short time, when the
exceeding roughness of the implements and machinery
then used for building purposes, is taken
into consideration. This ancient mansion is still
in existence and happily in excellent preservation.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom spent most of the early
part of their married life at Skipton; but during
the disturbances that accompanied the “Pilgrimage
of Grace,” the Lady Eleanor, with her
attendants and one of her children, a boy, were
removed to Bolton Abbey, some ten miles distant
from Skipton, a beautifully situated monastery,
which had been presented to the young Earl of
Cumberland shortly after its suppression. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the Lady Eleanor was in sore danger, for the
insurgents, having attacked the castle, informed
the young earl that they would hold the Lady
Eleanor and his child&mdash;who were entirely without
defence at Bolton&mdash;as hostages if he did not
surrender. They even threatened to place them
in front of the storming party, and if the attacks
on the castle were repelled, to hand them over
to the lowest camp-followers. Luckily, however,
assistance arrived in time, and the danger was
thereby averted. Both Clifford and his wife owed
their safety to young Christopher Aske, brother to
Robert Aske, one of the leaders of the rebellion.
This brave youth succeeded in passing, almost
single-handed, through the rebel camp, and contrived,
thanks to his knowledge of the country,
to bring relief to the earl at the castle, and,
going on to Bolton, carry the ladies out of the
abbey and conduct them, in the dead of night, to
a place of safety some miles off.</p>

<p>On the death of the old Earl of Cumberland, in
1542, his title passed to Eleanor’s husband, but
very shortly after this accession of rank, he successively
lost both his sons; the eldest, christened
Henry after his father, died when he was two
or three years of age, and was buried in the Clifford
family vault in Skipton Church, near his brother
Charles, who also died in infancy. The inconsolable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
young mother did not long survive her loss.
She retired to Brougham Castle, and died there in
November 1547, being buried at Skipton Church.
The most interesting fact connected with her brief
and (for those days) uneventful history, is that
her husband took his bereavement so much to
heart, that “on learning he was a widower, he
swooned and lay as one dead.” His attendants,
believing he had really passed away, stripped his
body, and were preparing to embalm it, when,
to their consternation, he suddenly revived and
struggled into a sitting position in his coffin.
Although the attendants were terribly frightened,
they soon realized what had happened, and very
sensibly placed him in a warm bed, gave him
a strong cordial to drink, and fed him, for
some days, on a diet of warm bread and milk.
He recovered his health, and, a few years later,
married a second time. He died in 1570 and is
buried in Skipton Church, between his two wives,
the Lady Eleanor Brandon and the Lady Anne
Dacres.</p>

<p>The Lady Eleanor is mentioned as the frequent
recipient of Henry VIII’s New Year and other
holiday gifts, which leads one to presume that she
was perhaps a greater favourite than her sister.
She seems to have had little or nothing to do with
the Greys, but there is mention in the Leicester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
archives of her visiting Bradgate in 1546; and,
if we may credit Burke, there was an intimacy
between her kinswoman, the Lady Philippa
Clifford, and Lady Jane Grey.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> With her step-mother,
the wily Katherine, Duchess of Suffolk,
she was evidently on good terms.</p>

<p>The eldest daughter of Henry Clifford and the
Lady Eleanor Brandon was the Lady Margaret
Clifford, who survived her parents and had a very
troubled career.</p>

<p>Of the childhood of this Lady Margaret little
or nothing is known, but in all probability it was
spent like that of her young cousins, the Greys.
In the writer’s life of Lady Jane Grey, mention
is made of a certain Mistress Huggins, who foolishly
boasted that she had heard it repeated about
London that the Duke of Northumberland intended
to marry his son, Guildford Dudley, to the Lady
Margaret Clifford. The publicity thus given to
his schemes seems to have induced the duke to
change them; and shortly afterwards, Northumberland
made an effort to secure the heiress for
his brother, Andrew Dudley, instead of Guildford,
who, as all know, married Lady Jane Grey.
Luckily for both parties, however, the project<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
fell through; and the Lady Margaret thus escaped
the fate that overwhelmed the Dudley family.</p>

<p>Lady Margaret is next heard of as one of the
ladies of the bedchamber at the court of Queen
Mary; and in 1555, with Her Majesty’s consent,
she was married, in Westminster Palace, with great
pomp, to Lord Strange, eldest son of the Earl of
Derby. Mary was too ill to attend her cousin’s
wedding, but the two Ladies Grey, and the queen’s
unpopular consort, Philip of Spain, were present,
and a great banquet was held in Westminster Hall
in honour of the bride and bridegroom, after which
the king displayed his prowess to much advantage
in a tilt in the Spanish style.</p>

<p>Although the Lady Margaret very often and
imprudently asserted her prior right to the Throne
over her cousins, the Ladies Katherine and Mary
Grey, she does not seem to have given umbrage
to Mary Tudor, and continued, until that queen’s
death, to take precedence of all the great ladies
of the court, her aunt, the Lady Frances, Duchess
of Suffolk, and her cousin Margaret, Countess of
Lennox, alone excepted. Nor was her position
greatly altered after Elizabeth’s accession. Her
husband, Lord Strange, enjoyed the “Great
Eliza’s” favour until his death, but he seems to
have entertained little affection or regard for his
wife, whom he left to her own devices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>The death, in 1570, of the Earl of Cumberland,
the Lady Margaret’s father, brought her a great
accession of wealth; and the subsequent demise
(in 1572) of her father-in-law, increased her rank,
for her husband then became Earl of Derby and
titular King in Man. After this event, Margaret’s
husband, who had been living separated from her,
seems to have become more friendly, and the
illustrious couple removed to Latham House in
Westmorland, where they kept up almost royal
state. It was not until after Elizabeth’s systematic
cruelty had broken the hearts of the Ladies
Katherine and Mary Grey that she seems to have
conceived it possible that the Lady Margaret
Clifford’s claims might, like those of Lady Katherine,
threaten her sovereign security. She had
received Lady Margaret’s eldest son, Fernando
Strange, into her household, and had treated him
with much kindness&mdash;he was, it is significantly
asserted, very good looking&mdash;but at the same time
the wily queen kept a strict watch on his movements,
lest the male heir of Lady Eleanor should
display the least inclination to encroach on her
prerogatives. Fernando, however, never gave her
the least cause for uneasiness. In 1594 he met
with a singular and sudden death, wherein witchcraft
was mixed up with a good deal of mystery of
a very suspicious and purely political kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards the middle of the year 1578, Elizabeth&mdash;for
some reason or other which has never
transpired, but not improbably at the suggestion
of Lord Derby, who was then high in her favour,
and who heartily detested his wife&mdash;began to look
upon Lady Margaret with disfavour. The poor
lady had been suffering from a sort of low fever,
and was recommended to try the skill of a certain
Dr. Randall, a famous physician, who was also
popularly held to be a wizard. Elizabeth sent
spies to Latham, and was soon informed that the
Lady Margaret and her soothsayer were conspiring
by magic arts against her, and were also entertaining
Jesuits, and other suspected persons.</p>

<p>Acting upon these evidently trumped-up
charges, Elizabeth ordered both the doctor and
his patient to be conveyed to London. In less
than a week, the wizard was arraigned, tried,
condemned, and hanged. The countess was
handed over to the strict custody of one of her
kinsmen, a Mr. Seckford, who resided in the then
fashionable suburb of Clerkenwell and held the
office of “Master of Requests”&mdash;a position which,
if the duties at all fitted in with the title, must
have entailed a great deal of hard work, in an age
when about half the aristocracy spent their lives
in petitioning or requesting mercy or other favours
for their imprisoned relatives. For all this, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
gentleman seems to have been interested in what
we should call the building or house-property
business, for the Lady Margaret’s numerous letters
are full of references to the many houses, not only
in Clerkenwell, but even at Hampstead and
Hackney, which he desired to sell or to let. He
seems to have treated the poor lady very kindly;
and, so far as possible under such circumstances,
she lived comfortably enough; but she was never
allowed to go out unaccompanied, and then only
within the precincts of the gardens or to make
purchases in shops in the neighbourhood. In her
correspondence she frequently mentions a court
jeweller named Brandon, presumably an illegitimate
son of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.
This tradesman was in favour with Elizabeth, who
employed him in mending and mounting her
innumerable watches, jewels, and clocks, and he
appears to have been on almost friendly terms
with the queen, and with the Lady Margaret, who,
if the above supposition is correct, was his cousin
once removed. He may have interceded for her
with the queen, as Walsingham, Cecil, and Hatton
undoubtedly did, but without the slightest result.
The Lady Margaret remained a close prisoner,
precisely as the Ladies Grey had been, being
quartered with Mr. Seckford until her death,
though not always at his house in Clerkenwell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
for she generally spent the summer months at
Hampstead, in a mansion rented by her from
the said Mr. Seckford. It seems she was never
allowed to live with her very unfaithful husband,
which was probably not considered a very
great deprivation by him. Elizabeth, with whom
he was in high favour, had appointed him Lord
High Steward of England, Judge for the trial of
the Earl of Arundel for treason, and Lord High
Chamberlain of Chester. When he died, in 1593,
Lady Margaret was given a sort of holiday, being
allowed to attend his funeral at Ormskirk in
Lancashire; their union had been blessed with
four sons and a daughter. On the Earl of Derby’s
death, his son, Fernando, assumed that title, as
well as that of King in Man, but did not enjoy these
honours long. In the spring of 1594, he was
suddenly taken ill, and died in a few hours. As
already hinted, a suggestive air of mystery hung
over his end. Some time in that year, he was
seized with fearful and sudden intestinal pains
which were popularly attributed to the occult
practices of one Dr. Hacket, in whose house was
afterwards found a small waxen figure said to
represent the young earl, and stuffed with hair
of the same colour as that of the supposed victim.
Accordingly as this wax image was maltreated, so,
in the opinion of the credulous, did the person it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
resembled suffer, and since it was stuck as full of
pins as any pincushion, there could be no doubt
as to the cause of young Strange’s prolonged
torments and terrible death! Hacket was, of
course, after having been duly tortured, hanged
as a wizard. The Lady Margaret survived her
eldest son by two years, dying, in 1596, at the
house in Clerkenwell, which she had rented from
Mr. Seckford before his death. She is buried in
St. Edmund’s Chapel in Westminster Abbey, near
her aunt, the Lady Frances. After the death
of Earl Fernando, the title of Earl of Derby and
King in Man passed to Lady Margaret’s youngest
son, Lord William Stanley, who married a De Vere,
youngest daughter of the Earl of Oxford, by his
wife, Cecil’s second daughter. This William
Stanley was the father of that loyal Earl of Derby
who was beheaded by Cromwell after the battle
of Worcester, and whose wife, Charlotte de la
Tremoïlle, has been immortalized by Sir Walter
Scott, who introduces her into a short but marvellously
effective and impressive scene in <i>Peveril
of the Peak</i>.</p>

<p class="p1">“Mr. Davey in this scholarly volume&mdash;it rests on original research&mdash;tells
without rhetorical appeal the moving story of the poor girl’s fate.... The
book is written with lightly handled knowledge and conspicuous charm.”&mdash;<i>The
Standard.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“Diving deep into historical records, Mr. Davey has given us not only a
most fascinating narrative of the chief conspiracies, but also some excellent
character sketches.... A most interesting volume, which may be read by
the general reader with profit, and will be heartily welcomed by students who
wish to arrive at a fuller knowledge of that extraordinary period.”&mdash;<i>The Globe.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“A fascinating narrative.... The work is one calculated to lure indolent
readers into perusing something of more permanent worth than third-rate
fiction.”&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“Mr. Richard Davey’s exhaustive and admirably written history.”&mdash;<i>Morning
Post.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“The story emerges clearly through an extraordinary amount of anecdote
and personal detail. The detail is never superfluous or indifferent. The
narrative and description alike hold the reader’s attention.... The wealth
of this new telling lies in the careful psychology and wealth of detail which we
have praised. Mr. Davey’s story is essentially exact....”&mdash;<i>The Athenæum.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“Mr. Davey has presented his tragic materials with fulness and clearness....
Among the best of historical biographies.... The work is,
indeed, far better than most of the memoirs of this kind, and should have
more than a season’s success. It is evidently the fruit of long and careful
study, and is admirably presented.”&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p class="p1">(Extract from a long review of this work by M. T. de Wyzewa in the <i>Revue
des Deux Mondes</i> for April 15, 1910).</p>

<p>“La haute portée de l’ouvrage de M. Davey lui vient surtout de ce que,
après avoir écarté ces fables que l’imagination populaire a amoncelées pendant
plusieurs siècles, et sous lesquelles la personne authentique de la petite reine
improvisée nous apparaît enfin, pour la première fois, dans son émouvante
simplicité, l’auteur s’est attaché à évoquer devant nous les vigoureuses et
sinistres figures des acteurs principaux du drame. <i>Jamais encore</i>, je crois,
<i>aucun historien</i> n’a reconstitué avec autant de relief et de couleur pittoresque
le tableau des intrigues ourdies autour du trône du vieil Henry VIII et de son
pitoyable successeur Edouard VI.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">“The grim annals of the Tower of London have already been treated by
various historians, but there is still room for an accurate, yet animated, work
such as Mr. Richard Davey has produced. His topography is carefully done,
and he has a nice eye for architecture. Mr. Davey sets forth the facts with
spirit; we get, indeed, a singularly complete record.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“Mr. Davey’s competent and readable book will rank among the best upon
its subject. Mr. Davey has two conspicuous qualifications for a work of this
kind; he is careful about his authorities and he writes uncommonly well....
In writing of the Tudor period Mr. Davey is at his best. He shows the true
historian’s gift for dissecting motive and probing to the heart of a situation,
and he keeps the interest continually quivering with the spirit of suggestion
and interpretation.... A book packed with historical interest.”&mdash;<i>Daily
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“Mr. Davey’s book is one which no visitor to the Tower, or any one
interested in that grim building, should fail to read. He writes pleasantly;
the wonderful story he has to tell is related with full appreciation of its
dramatic possibilities. Mr. Davey is at his best in relating the tragedies of the
Tower.”&mdash;<i>Evening Standard.</i></p></div>

the historian and anecdotist, and the result is one that is admirable.... It
would be easy to quote innumerable passages of admirable description, of well-told
historical incidents, of pleasant anecdotes.... A deeply interesting
book, quite unlike the conventional topographical works.”&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

The acquaintance of Katherine the Fair with Owen
Tudor must have begun a great deal earlier than 1423, the
date usually stated. There exists in the British Museum, a
picturesque old French novel, entitled <i>Tidéric, Prince de
Galles</i>&mdash;founded, according to its anonymous author, on little-known
documents amongst the French archives&mdash;which
describes Katherine as having fallen in love with Owen
during the negotiations for her marriage with Henry V.
The handsome Welshman certainly distinguished himself at
Agincourt, and subsequent to that momentous battle, was
created Captain of the King’s Guard, in which position he
became a confidential attendant on the Sovereign. In that
quality, we gather, he was sent with a message to Princess
Katherine, who then and there fell in love with him. He was
next&mdash;and this is an historical fact&mdash;created Clerk of the
Wardrobe to the queen, and was, therefore, constantly in
her company. When both the king and queen returned to
France, and Henry died, Owen escorted the young dowager
back to England. In the <i>Histoire de Boulogne</i>, a “M. Tidder”
is described as being in the queen’s procession, which followed
“at a distance of two miles” that conveying the king’s body
through northern France on its way to England. The
queen’s procession entered Montreuil-sur-Mer one hour after
the one which bore the royal corpse had left that town,
“M. Tidder” leading the way, on a white horse. The queen
and her party paused to partake of refreshments offered by
the mayor, and it was late in the afternoon before they left
Montreuil for Boulogne and Calais, where Katherine embarked
for England at nightfall, but not on the vessel that carried
the king’s body.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Thus Katherine may have had many a meeting with Owen
long before her gallant husband’s death. The adventure at
the dance, which history relates as a fact, very likely occurred,
and kindled a passion that resulted in the secret and momentous
union, the precise date of which is lost.</p>

Among the statutes of the foundation of Bermondsey
Abbey was one whereby certain apartments were to be

the monks having a great reputation as skilful leeches and

Woodville and other royal ladies being permitted to
reside at times in a monastery inhabited by monks.</p>

The origin of this Lady Mortimer, who, for her sins and
sorrows, yielded at a mature age to the blandishments of the
very youthful Charles Brandon, has hitherto baffled the
researches of historians. Quite by chance the writer discovered
her identity. Happening one day to turn over the
pages of Blomefield’s invaluable <i>History of Norfolk</i>, under
the heading “Inglethorpe” in the Lynn district, he found,
included in the pedigree of the ancient family which gives its
name to this manor, that of the Lady Mortimer. It appears
that Sir Edmond de Bellasis, Lord of Inglethorpe or Ingaldesthorpe,
who died, seized of that manor, in the thirty-sixth
year of Henry V’s reign, was the last of his line. He had,
by his wife, the Lady Joan de Boase, a daughter and heiress,
Isabel, who married John Nevill, Marquis Montagu or
Montacute, brother to the famous “Kingmaker,” Richard
Nevill, Earl of Warwick. This lady had two sons and five
daughters. Her eldest son died in infancy, and the second,
George, eventually followed the fortunes of his uncle, the
Earl of Warwick, and rose, under Edward IV, to be Duke of
Bedford, but was deprived of this title and of his estates by
Richard III. He died without issue, bequeathing what
remained of his fortune amongst his five sisters, one of
whom, the Lady Margaret Nevill, married Sir John Mortimer,
who, dying on the field of battle at Bosworth without issue,
left her very richly dowered. Being considerably over forty
when Charles Brandon was in his nineteenth year (it will be
remembered that he was a mere child at the time of the battle
of Bosworth), she fell a victim to the youth’s fascinations,
and married him, to the amazement of the Venetian ambassador,
who comments upon the affair in a note to his government,
saying: “In this country [England] young men marry
old ladies for their money, and here, for instance, is the Duke
of Suffolk, who, at nineteen, married a lady, for her wealth,
in whose house he dwelt, and who is old enough to be his
grandmother.” This Lady Mortimer had a sister, the Lady
Lucy Nevill, who married Sir Anthony Browne, governor
of Calais, and who was the mother of that Anne Browne, to
whom Brandon was betrothed at the time of his marriage
with the Lady Mortimer. To add to the confusion, it seems
that Brandon’s grandmother, Elizabeth Wingfield, had a
youngest sister who married Robert Mortimer, brother to
the above-named Sir John, and was therefore sister-in-law
to the Lady Margaret Mortimer and Brandon’s great-aunt.
These alliances, at a time when not only consanguinity, but
spiritual affinity, was taken into consideration in matters
matrimonial, rendered it exceedingly easy for certain thoughtlessly
undertaken marriages to be annulled by the ecclesiastical
tribunals.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is in this pedigree another curious fact which tells
indirectly upon the tragic history of the three sisters Grey,
since it proves that there existed a connecting link between
the Brandons and the Greys as far back as the beginning
of the fifteenth century. The Lady Joan, widow of the last
Lord Inglethorpe, married the first Lord Grey de Ruthen,
and thereby became the immediate ancestress of that Henry
Grey who married Brandon’s daughter by the French queen,
the Lady Frances, and was the father of the three unfortunate
sisters, Jane, Katherine and Mary Grey. This connection very
probably led to the choice of Henry Grey as consort for the
Lady Frances Brandon, Mary Tudor’s eldest daughter.</p>

Reginald de la Pole, head of this great house, was
beheaded on June 30, 1513, for an alleged treasonable correspondence

of the White Rose” (Perkin Warbeck) upon the English

Other lands and mansions assigned to Charles Brandon
from time to time were: the manors of Austin’s and Gerard’s
in the parish of Darsham (Suffolk), given at the Dissolution;
Leiston Abbey (Suffolk), granted in 1536&mdash;it is said that the
patronage of this abbey had been in the Brandon family
for generations, but Charles exchanged it with the Crown
for Henham Hall; properties at Laxfield and Middleton in
Suffolk, attached to Leiston Abbey, granted to Brandon at
the Dissolution; the Priory of St. Mary of Mendham (Suffolk),
which came to Brandon through his fourth wife, Catherine,
Lady Willoughby of Eresby, she being lineally descended
from a sister of Sir William de Ufford, on whom it had been
settled&mdash;Brandon conveyed it to one Richard Freston for
an annual rent of forty pounds; the estate of Combs, which
was an inheritance in the right of Catherine, Lady Willoughby,
and eventually passed to her second husband, Richard Bertie,
Esq.; Haughley Castle, manor and estate (Suffolk), an apanage
of the de la Poles; and Cavenham, granted to Suffolk
on the attainder of the Duke of Buckingham. Strange to
say, Suffolk rarely visited any of his numerous castles and
manor-houses. He lived in London. His favourite country
house was Westhorpe Hall; but he died at Guildford Castle,
which did not belong to him. The estate in Southwark came
to him in 1502 on the death of his uncle Thomas, who had
inherited it in his turn from his grandfather, who died in
1497. Charles so enlarged the house that it became a palace,
second only in size and magnificence to the royal palace at
Kennington. These facts prove&mdash;the majority of the historians
of London to the contrary notwithstanding&mdash;that
Suffolk Place was not a gift to Brandon from the king, but
an inheritance from his forefathers.</p>

Mary, however, with the kindness of heart which
characterized her, saw that they eventually obtained some
recognition of their services. According to documents in the
French archives, her goldsmith, one William Verner, of Fleet
Street, London, was ordered to prepare certain jewelry, to the
value of six hundred gold crowns, to be disbursed as gifts to
the impecunious gentlewomen dismissed in France. Amongst
these valuable presents were a polished ruby and an emerald
set in a gold cross, value two hundred <i>écus de soleil</i>; a diamond
and sapphire set in a necklace, value three hundred crowns;
and a table diamond worth one hundred crowns. The gems
were to be worn at court, in order that all might see that
the ladies had not been defrauded of their just dues.</p>

“When,” says Suffolk, “I came to Paris, the queen was
in hand with me the day after. She said ‘she must be short
with me and show to me her pleasure and mind,’ and so
she began, and showed how good a lady she was to me, and
if I would be ordered by her, she verily would have none but
me.” “An ever I come to England,” said the youthful
dowager to Suffolk, “I never shall have you, and therefore
plainly an you marry me not now, I will never have you
nor never come into England.” Suffolk replied, “You say
that but to prove me withal.” “I would but you knew
well,” answered Mary, “at your coming to Paris how it was
shown to me.” “I asked her,” continued Suffolk, “what
that was?” “The best in France has been with me,”
replied Mary. Here she clearly indicated Francis I, and
from him she had intelligence which added to her excitement.
“An I go to England,” continued she to Suffolk,
“then I am sent to Flanders, and I would be torn to pieces
rather than ever come there.” “And with that,” pursues
Suffolk, “she weeped as never I saw woman so weep.”</p>

beautiful creature [than Mary], or one possessed of so much
grace and sweetness.” Gerard de Pleine writes: “I assure
you that she [Mary] is one of the most beautiful young women
in the world. I think I never saw a more charming creature.
She is very graceful. Her deportment in dancing and in
conversation is as pleasing as you could desire. There is
nothing gloomy or melancholy about her.... I assure you
that she has been well educated.... I had imagined
that she would have been very tall; but she is of middling
height....” (<i>Lettres de Louis XII</i>, tome iv., p. 335; State

It is not at all improbable that this, the generally received
version of what we should call the <i>affaire Mortimer</i>, is incorrect.
Cokayne says she married, after her separation
from Brandon, a gentleman named Downes&mdash;the <i>Baronagium</i>
calls him Horn. In this case she was already out
of court, and the action of Brandon and Wolsey for a papal
absolute nullification of the former’s marriage was to make
the position of the queen-duchess and her children entirely
unassailable. (See the <i>Baronagium Angl.</i>; also, Brooke’s <i>Catalogue</i>,
p. 141.) The third marriage of Lady Mortimer seems
to have been overlooked by historians. Had Lady Mortimer’s
marriage with Brandon been confirmed by the pope,
both she and Brandon would have been liable to the charge
of bigamy, and the succession to the throne claimed by the
daughter of the queen-duchess by Brandon would have
been <i>ipso facto</i> invalid.</p>

Lady Monteagle, who bore her husband six children, died
in 1544. Her husband, Thomas Stanley, succeeded his father
as Viscount Monteagle, 1522, and was made K.B. at the
Coronation of Anne Boleyn. His second wife was Helen
Preston of Livens. (See Dugdale’s <i>Baronagium</i>, Machyn’s
<i>Diary</i>, etc.) These dates prove conclusively that the lovely
woman in the sketch by Holbein, inscribed “the Lady Monteagle,”
is intended for the daughter of Charles Brandon, and is

In the register of St. Mary Matfellon, Whitechapel, is
the record of the burial of Richard Brandon, “a man out of
Rosemary Lane.” The entry is dated June 2, 1649, and to
it is appended a note to the effect that “this Richard Brandon
is supposed to have cut off the head of Charles I.” This
man is said to have confessed that he received thirty pounds
for the job, which was paid him in half-crowns within an hour
after the execution had taken place; he took an orange stuck
with cloves, and a handkerchief, from the king’s pocket,
and sold the former article to a gentleman for ten shillings.
Richard Brandon was the son of Gregory Brandon, and claimed
the office of headsman by inheritance. His first victim was
the Earl of Strafford. In a very old MS. on armorial bearings,
dated 1692, lately in the possession of the author, is the
marginal note in an antique handwriting: “Charles Brandon,
who was cousin to Queen Elizabeth, had an ill-begotten son
Gregory, whose son Richard beheaded Charles I.”</p>

Mary Tudor, Queen Dowager of France and Duchess of
Suffolk, was buried in a magnificent alabaster monument
in Bury St. Edmunds Abbey, which was destroyed at the
Dissolution. Although the abbey church was blown up with
gunpowder, the townspeople carried the coffin, containing
the queen’s body, to the parish church, where it was reinterred
near the high altar, and covered with some altar
slabs brought from the desecrated abbey. The alabaster
monument was destroyed. In 1734 the remains of Mary
Tudor were unearthed and her coffin was opened. The body,
that of a large woman, with a profusion of golden hair adhering
to the skull, was found to be in a perfect state of preservation.
It was re-buried close to the right of the altar, where a modern
inscription on a marble tablet, let into the wall, may still be
read.</p>

Aylmer, however, knew Lady Katherine Grey well, for
in one of his letters from Italy he desires to be remembered to

share in her education; but whereas Jane Grey’s calligraphy

her letters are not well expressed.</p>

Blanche Parry was the widow of Sir Thomas Parry, who
succeeded Mr. Saintlow as comptroller of the queen’s household.
She was a palmist of considerable skill; and an ancient
black-letter volume on Palmistry, containing a great many
very curious plates, is still in the library at Charlcote Hall.
It is said by tradition to have belonged to Blanche Parry:
if so, she “told the hand” exactly as it is “told” by the
occult sisterhood of Bond Street and other fashionable parts
of London in our time. Mrs. Parry was also a crystal-gazer.</p>

Dr. Dee, who was born in 1527, was a man of superior
attainments, and a clever mathematician. He took his
degree as Master of Arts in 1548 at Cambridge. Being
suspected as a sorcerer, he left England in the same year,
but returned in the reign of Edward VI, who took a great
fancy to him. Under Mary, he was imprisoned for attempting
the queen’s life by witchcraft. After Elizabeth ascended
the throne, he became such a favourite with her that she
sent her own doctors to him when he was ill; and she also
despatched him to investigate the recently discovered American
territory. In 1583 he went to live in Bohemia with a
Polish nobleman, who was likewise suspected of necromancy,
and the two succeeded in imposing on a great many people
on the Continent. Dee eventually returned to England, was
made Chancellor of St. Paul’s Cathedral, and died at Mortlake
in 1608. He possessed a magic mirror in which Elizabeth
placed great faith and which she frequently consulted.</p>

The scheme is succinctly recounted in a letter from Sir
Thomas Challoner, then English ambassador at Madrid, to
Cecil, which will be found in the State Papers (Foreign Series)
for the reign of Elizabeth. “King Philip II,” he says,
“is so jealous of the anticipated power of France, by the
alliance of young Francis the Dauphin with the Queen of
Scotland, and her claims to the Crown of England, that he
positively contemplates stealing Lady Katherine Grey out
of the realm, and marrying her to his son, Don Carlos, or
some other member of his family, and setting up her title
against that of Mary Stuart, as the true heiress of England.
Lady Katherine will probably be glad to go, being most
uncomfortably situated in the English court with the queen,
who cannot well abide the sight of her, and neither the
duchess her mother nor her step-father love her, and her
uncle cannot abide to hear of her, so that she lives, as it were,
in great despair. She has spoken very arrogant and unseemly
words in the hearing of the queen and others standing
by. Hence it is thought that she could be enticed away if
some trusty person speak with her.”</p>

Durham House, Strand, at one time the town residence
of the Bishops of Durham, was ceded to the famous Duke
of Northumberland; and Lady Jane Grey was married, and
Lady Katherine betrothed, in the private chapel. It afterwards
passed into the possession of the Archbishops of York, under
Mary, and was finally leased by Elizabeth to the Spanish
Embassy. The name of Durham Place and Durham Court,
Strand, until lately marked the site of this at one time
magnificent mansion.</p>

It was even rumoured about the court that the marriage
had actually taken place in secret. Quadra, writing to the
King of Spain under date November 20, 1560, says: “They
say [Robert Dudley] was married to the queen in the presence
of his brother and two ladies of the chamber.”</p>

<p class="pfc4 p1">“<span class="smcap">Good Master Secretary</span>,</p>
<p class="pfi8">“Hearing a great bruit that my Lady Katherine
Grey is in the Tower, and also that she should say she
is married already to my son, I could not choose but trouble
you with my cares and sorrows thereof. And although I
might, upon my son’s earnest and often protesting to me
the contrary, desire you to be an humble suitor on my behalf,
that her tales might not be credited before my son did answer,
yet, instead thereof, my first and chief suit is that the Queen’s
Majesty will think and judge of me in this matter, according
to my desert and meaning. And if my son have so much
forgotten Her Highness calling him to honour, and so much
overshot his bounden duty, and so far abused Her Majesty’s
benignity, yet never was his mother privy or consenting
thereunto. I will not fill my letter with how much I have
schooled and persuaded him to the contrary, nor yet will I
desire that youth and fear may help, excuse, or lessen his
fault; but only that Her Highness will have that opinion of
me as of one that, neither for child nor friend, shall willingly
neglect the duty of a faithful subject. And to conserve my
credit with Her Majesty, good Master Secretary, stand now
my friend, that the wildness of mine unruly child do not
minish Her Majesty’s favour towards me. And thus so
perplexed with this discomfortable rumour I end, not
knowing how to proceed nor what to do therein. Therefore,
good Master Secretary, let me understand some comfort
of my grief from the Queen’s Majesty, and some counsel
from yourself, and so do leave you to God.</p>

Parrots and monkeys were apparently favourite domestic
pets at the end of the sixteenth century&mdash;the Duchess of
Northumberland (the widow of John Dudley), for instance,
left her grey parrot to the Duchess of Alva; in itself a slight

gradually spreading. The animals were probably brought
from the north of Africa, Algeria, Morocco, etc.</p>

“Out of the fifteen or sixteen of them (i.e. members of

be impossible to please them all, but I am sure in the end
they would form two or three parties and that the Catholic
party would have on its side the majority of the country,
although I do not know whether the Catholics themselves
would be able to agree, as some would like the Queen of Scots
and others Lady Margaret [Lennox].”&mdash;Quadra to the

Lord John Grey, the Duke of Suffolk’s brother, had
himself been imprisoned in the Tower for eight months in
1554, for his alleged share in Suffolk’s rebellion in favour of
Lady Jane Grey. His was a courtesy title, and he was sometimes
called “Sir” John. Pirgo was granted to him by the
queen on April 24, 1559, but he evidently found some difficulty
in keeping it up, for shortly afterwards he wrote to
Cecil begging him “to acquaint the queen with his embarrassed
circumstances, as they affect her former grant.”</p>

It is a curious fact that the grandmother of Jane Dormer,
Duchess of Feria, whom we have had occasion to mention in

being that Sebastian Newdigate, a monk of the Charterhouse,
London, who was executed under Henry VIII for
denying the royal supremacy. The Duchess of Somerset’s
husband, Sergeant Francis Newdigate, was of this same
family. These Newdigates had a fine house in Charterhouse
Square, which they occasionally let, furnished, for the season
to Lord Latimer, Katherine Parr’s third husband.</p>

“Stuff delivered in August, 1561, by the Queen’s commandments

Bentley, out of the Wardrobe in the Tower, to Sir
Edward Warner, Knight, then levetenant of the Tower, for
the necessary furniture of Lady Katherine Grey’s chamber.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“First: six pieces of tapestry to hang her chamber. (‘Very
old and coarse.’) Item: a spavier (?) for a bed of changeable
damask. (‘All to-broken and not worth tenpence.’)
One silk quilt of red striped with gold. (‘Stark naught.’)
Two carpets of Turkey matting. (‘The wool is all worn.’)
Item: one chair of cloth of gold with crimson velvet, with

No. 7, fol. 110) is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc6 p1">“But because you shall truly know what charges my lord
[Hertford] is at, and hath been at, with my lady [Katherine],
since her coming hither, I have herein enclosed true inventory,
besides my lady’s whole furniture of her and hers, with
hangings, bedding, sheets, drapery and plate, for neither she
nor her little boy hath one piece of plate to drink, eat, or
keep anything, but of me; which, though it cannot be much,
yet is as much as I have.... I learn from Hanworth that
he [Hertford] hath been very plain with Newdigate, since
which Lady Katherine hath received twenty pounds, and
been promised to have beds and sheets sent to her, howbeit
they have not yet come; she had nothing to send any friend
at New Year’s tide, which induced Lady Clinton to give Lady
Grey a pair of silk hose, to present to Lady Knowles in Lady
Katherine’s name, as if from her.” Lord John goes on to say
that he thinks Newdigate ought to have told Cecil how unprovided
she was when she first arrived at Pirgo: “for the
inventory of all she had when he left her here I could send
to you, but I am ashamed, for that it was so bare.”</p>

The inventory includes the following items:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc6 p1">“Two coats for Mr. Thomas [Katherine’s baby, then about
eleven months], whereof the one is russet damask, the other
of crimson velvet. Of white cloth to make him petticoats,
two yards. Of red cloth to make him like petticoats, two
yards. Velvet caps for him, two. A russet taffeta hat for
him, laid on with silver cord.... Two pairs of fine sheets
for my Lady Katherine, of two breadths. Black velvet to
make a gown for my Lady Katherine, bound with sables, ten
yards. Russet velvet to make a gown and a kirtle. Black
and russet lace to the gown and kirtle. Damask to make a
nightgown for my Lady. Crimson satin to make a petticoat.
A petticoat of crimson velvet. A velvet hood for my Lady.
Two pairs of black silk hose. Black cloth to make a cloak.
Two yards of cambric to make ruffs, plattes, coverchiefs
and handkerchiefs, six ells. Linen to make smocks, ten
ells. Silver dishes and saucers for her use. The charge of
weekly rate for her board, 46s. 8d.; for her child, 13s. 4d.;
for his nurse, 6s. 8d.; her three ladies, each 6s. 8d.; for her
two men-servants, 5s. each; the same for her laundress and
the widow that washeth the child’s clothes.”</p>

“I find myself not a little bound unto your Lordship for
the friendly welcoming and honourable using of my Lady
my mother since her now being at the Court, as also your
well-tried and goodly noble furthering her long and troublesome
suit for us, to our most gracious Queen. Wherein, as
always, so now, I still crave your especial and most humble

of Her Highness’s intolerable displeasure, the great weight
whereof hath sufficiently taught us never again to offend so
merciful a Princess. And so I beseech you, my good Lord,
now on our behalf, who pray not for earthly things so much
as the comfort of her too long wasted favour. My trust is
God will bless your Lordship’s travails with the fruit thereof,
and by your means, wherein, next Him, we only depend,
turn the sorrowful mourning of us, Her Majesty’s poor captives,
into a countershine comfort, for which I rest in continual
prayer. And so I take my leave, beseeching Almighty
God long to preserve her, and make me so happy as to enjoy
the company of so dear a lord and friend as I have, and do

Guzman de Silva, writing to the King of Spain, states
that the book was written “in the interests of Katherine in
the matter of the succession, and mainly consisted of two
points: first, as to whether King Henry’s will was valid or
not, as in it this Katherine is appointed amongst others as
his successor; and secondly, the question of the Scotch Queen
being an alien.”&mdash;Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.
p. 427.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The validity of Henry VIII’s will was questioned on the
ground that the king did not sign it with his own hand, but
by means of a stamp. See <i>The Nine-days’ Queen</i> (R. Davey),
pp. 109, 110.</p>

that some other plot for her sudden seizure was feared.</p>

The accounts sent in by Sir Owen Hopton to the Exchequer
are divided into three bills, the first for the expenses
of Lady Katherine’s keep before her death; the second for
the funeral expenses; and the third for the heralds’ fees.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The first, endorsed “The charges of the Lady Catherine
and of her servants until her funeral at Sir Owen Hopton’s,”
begins with the cost of her transport from Gosfield, already
detailed, and continues:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Itm’; for the diet of the Lady Katherine and the
board of her ordinary servants, by the time and space of
fourteen weeks, at 5 li. the week, 70 li.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Itm’; for the board of the Lady Katherine’s ordinary
servants sithens her departure [i.e. since her death], by
the time of three weeks and three days at 33s. 4d. the
week, 6 li.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Itm’; for sending to London three times while the
Lady Katherine was sick, 3 li.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Itm’; for the charge of Doctor Simondes and his
man and his horse at Cockfield twice (left blank).</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Itm’; for my own charge two times coming to
London (also blank).”</p>
<p class="pfc4">
The charges for the funeral, exclusive of the embalming,
are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Imprimis; for four meals and two nights’ lodging
of all the mourners, being to the number of 77, for their
horsemeat during that time, 40 li. Besides a great number
of comers to see the solemnity of that burial.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Itm’; paid to the singing men at the same funeral, 20s.</p>
<p class="pfc6">
“Itm’; paid for the watchers of the Lady Katherine,
40s.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">By a warrant of February 6 (1568) the Exchequer was
ordered to pay Sir Owen £76 for the heralds’ expenses at
“the interment and burial of our cousin the Lady Katheryne
lately deceased, daughter of our entirely beloved cousin the
Lady Frances Duchess of Suffolk.” The most interesting of
these expenses are the following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc6">“For the liveries of one herald, 5 yards at 16s. the
yard, 4 li.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“For the herald’s fee, 3 li. 6s. 8d., &amp; for his transportation
hither and back again at 6d. a mile, 3 li. 7s.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“For Mr. Garter’s fee, 10 li.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“To the painter, for a great banner of arms, 50s.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“For 6 great scutcheons on paste paper, 3 li.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“For 2 dozen of scutcheons of paper in metal for
garnishing of the house and the church, and 6 dozen of
paper scutcheons in colours, 6 li. 8s.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Itm’; paid to the tailors for working of the cloth &amp;
other things upon the hearse, 20s.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">In these expenses, Hopton expended the whole £76; and
by a warrant to the Exchequer dated March 10, 1568, order
was given to pay him £140 “for the board of our cousin the
Lady Katheryne and of her servants while she was in his
keeping, and for charges for her coming thither, as also for
money laid out by him for household charges during her
sickness and belonging thereunto.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">(These documents will be found in the State Papers,
Domestic, Elizabeth, vol. xlvi., fols. 23, 24, 48, 49.)</p>

It has been said by recent historians, and notably by
Burke, that Lady Katherine reverted to the Catholic Church
before her death. So far as the present writer has been able
to ascertain, there exists no documentary nor any contemporary
evidence to support this theory. The burial service
cannot have been any but that of the Book of Common
Prayer, seeing all Roman Catholic rites were prohibited
in England at this time. <i>The Manner of Her Departing</i>,
whilst it expressly states that she read, in her last hours,
the Prayers for the Visitation of the Sick in the English Book
of Common Prayer, curiously enough, does not say whether
any minister of religion was present at her deathbed.</p>

Mr. W. L. Rutton’s translation of the very crude Latin
inscription on this tomb runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Sacred to the Memory of Edward, Earl of Hertford, Baron
Beauchamp, Son and Heir of the most illustrious Prince,
Edward, Duke of Somerset, Earl of Hertford, Viscount
Beauchamp and Baron of St. Maur [Seymour], Knight Companion
of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Uncle and
Governor of King Edward VI, the most worthy Protector
of his Kingdoms, Lordships and Dependencies, Commander-in-Chief
of the Army and Lord Lieutenant, Lord Treasurer
and Earl Marshal of England, Governor and Captain of the
Islands of Guernsey and Jersey: by Anne his wife, of most
illustrious and ancient descent.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“And also of his most dearly beloved wife, Catherine,
Daughter and heiress of Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, by his
Duchess, Frances, daughter and heiress of Charles Brandon,
Duke of Suffolk, by Mary, sister of Henry VIII, Queen of
France, and thus by descent the great-granddaughter of
Henry VII. Incomparable consorts [Katherine and Hertford],
who experienced in the vicissitudes of changing fortune,
at length, in the concord which marked their lives, here rest
together.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“She, a woman of exceptional quality, of honour, piety,
beauty and constancy, the best and most illustrious, not
only of her own, but every age. Piously and peacefully
she expired, the 22nd of January 1563. [A complete
error.]</p>
<p class="pfc6">“He, A man of perfect integrity, a pattern of nobility, a
guardian of morals and early training, of eloquence, prudence,
blamelessness and gravity, nor less distinguished by
virtue and learning than by the lustre of noble birth, as one
who was associated in his youthful studies with Prince
Edward, son of King Henry VIII. An ardent champion of
religion; the never-failing maintainer of right and justice;
of consummate fidelity and influence in administration of
the provinces committed to him. Plenipotentiary for James,
King of Great Britain, in the legation to the Archduke and
Duchess (of the Netherlands). Great in his munificence at
home and abroad, and although of surpassing wealth, yet
he did more largely abound in mental than in material opulence,
nor ever did he exercise his power on the weakness of
his dependants. Full of honours as of years, in his eighty-third
year he yielded to Nature, the 6th of April 1621. By
the heroine (of this epitaph) he had two sons.”</p>

It is remarkable that the official account of Katherine’s
death makes no allusion to her final parting from her younger
son, now five years old. He most certainly went with his
mother to Cockfield Hall; but judging from the above quotation,
was, on Lady Katherine’s death, handed over to the
care of the queen’s attendants.</p>

Probably the reason why Lady Jane, when she was
despatching loving farewells to her father and Lady Katherine,
her sister, did not send a message to Lady Mary, was that
she deemed her too young to realize the situation. But it
is strange that no mention of her should have been made in
the letter to the Lady Katherine on the pages of Jane’s Greek
Testament.</p>

The Water-gate was destroyed about 1808; it was very
solidly built, and there was a great deal of difficulty in
removing it.</p>

A picture of “Queen Elizabeth’s porter” at Hampton
Court Palace probably represents Master Keyes.</p>

Amongst Keyes’s duties was the adjudication of all disputes
and brawls amongst the palace servants, whom his
attendants had the power of chastising, under his orders;
but he had other offices of a more dignified nature. The
State Papers contain a document, signed by the queen, and
dated January 2, 1558, in which certain noblemen and gentlemen
are urged to levy and arm their servants, to the number
of fifty each, for the relief of Calais. These auxiliaries are to
be sent to Dover, where they will be received by “Thomas
Keyes, the Sergeant-Porter.”</p>

Mr. Knollys was the second son of Sir Francis Knollys
and of Katherine Carey, Anne Boleyn’s niece, and therefore
Elizabeth’s first cousin, as well as a relative of Mr. Keyes.</p>

This is obscure; we do not know to what letter she alludes.</p>

This sum was derived from the estates of Ferrars-Groby
and Bonville, of which, since they descended to the female
heirs, she should have been co-heiress with her sister Katherine,
had not Elizabeth, without the slightest justification (these
lands did not come under the head of the Duke of Suffolk’s
confiscated property), annexed the greater part of their
income.</p>

The fact that, as it would appear, Lady Mary had at
some time or other used this identical piece of cloth as a
cloth of state, to demonstrate her relationship to royalty,
probably caused the dowager duchess to speak so disrespectfully
of it.</p>

It is impossible to say whether this is a mere figure of

As Mr. Stokes did not die until November 30, 1586,
Lady Mary, who predeceased him, never received this
legacy.</p>

At the time of her death in 1578, at all events, she was
living in a house of her own, for she disposes of it without
mention of any other claim upon it. This house was evidently
somewhere near Aldersgate Street.</p>

This gentleman married Anne Willoughby, who was a
cousin of Katherine, dowager Duchess of Suffolk, so that he
was really in a sense a “cowsine” or cousin of Lady Mary
Grey and her sisters.</p>
